2710 Chats - 1 Year[Daniel]:	Oh hello! :)
[Paola]:	I found this easier than on the phone while at work
[Daniel]:	Oh definitely easier! This way we can have some continuity between conversations too!
[Daniel]:	So then, do you like thunderstorms or no?
[Paola]:	Yes! Well hopefully you don't have any excuses now. lol jk 
[Paola]:	But yes I do! sometimes though. I don't like when It gets to bad to the point where there is a warning for tornados.
[Daniel]:	Yes, that was kinda scary the other day 
		😕
		 but same! mostly I like them and think they are really majestic and beautiful.
[Paola]:	You are from Wheaton right? You were a lot closer.
		Isn't it crazy how the clouds are what carry all that water? lol sometimes I think about it... and I'm like how? 
[Daniel]:	Yeah, it was pretty close to where  I was. It is definitely crazy that water falls from the sky at all, I wonder as well. I was looking at a global radar the other day and saw these massive storms over theoceans.
[Daniel]:	They were so big
[Paola]:	And storms over on the ocean I feel like are more scary! I'm scared of Tsunamis also 
[Daniel]:	Have you ever seen the movie poseidon?
[Paola]:	Yes, I have. Reasons why I don't go on ships lol
[Daniel]:	Lol have any other reasons?
[Paola]:	I think the biggest one. I don't know how to swim:( 
[Daniel]:	Oh really? Well I can help you improve! I used to be a swim instructor for some time.
[Daniel]:	Of course, my hand kinda keeping me out of the water for now.
[Paola]:	Yeah :(( but soon it will get better!
[Daniel]:	Haha I gotta go see the doctor tomorrow morning
[Paola]:	Oh really, so you won't be in here making your coffee?
[Daniel]:	Guess not , the appointment is at 7:00 a.m. so hopefully I can be here pretty early.
[Paola]:	Ok then if you come tomorrow let me know how your appointment went.
[Daniel]:	Will do see you tomrrow
[Daniel]:	I just looked at your text from last night, and of course I meant to say you look good everyday. Including today 
		😉
		 
[Paola]:	You just made my whole day (: 
		I'll see you tomorrow
[Daniel]:	You already left? That is sad! I will text you later!
[Paola]:	I'm back though! You coming today?
[Daniel]:	🙂
		 im here, I will come out and chat in a minute 
[Daniel]:	Its sad you are so busy this weekend, I was going to ask you to hang out ! 
[Paola]:	Yeah, well maybe it can be some other time (:
[Daniel]:	Maybe! I will say I don't know what we would do, so I am open to suggestions.
[Paola]:	We could go to the carnival!?
[Daniel]:	That sounds like a great idea ! I googled and found like three, which one were you thinking?
[Paola]:	Which ones are for next week?
[Daniel]:	https://g.co/kgs/WQEPYX
[Paola]:	You know what I remembered I did hear that the Glendale fest will be canceled this year due to covid.. but I'm not fully sure
[Daniel]:	http://www.glendaleheightsfest.com/thankyou.asp
		 
[Daniel]:	😞
		 
[Paola]:	:(( Oh so it is true
[Daniel]:	So then when should go out then? no carnivals any time soon it looks like
[Paola]:	Well I'm sure there will be more during this month. I'm just not sure where exactly. I heard windy city amusements will return to Lombard the upcoming week or weekend I believe. I don't know if that's too far for you?
[Daniel]:	If you want, we could try an amusement park ! I would definitely be down. Do you like rollercoasters?
[Daniel]:	Looks like windy city amusements is indeed coming to town this weekend! Should we go to that?
[Paola]:	Oh great! yeah, we could definitely do that. What days will they be here?
[Daniel]:	Friday - Sunday 
		🙂
[Paola]:	What day do you think would be best?
[Daniel]:	Friday sounds best to me , but I would be super down to do saturday as well
[Paola]:	What are their closing times? Because one of the carnivals I went they closed at 8pm -_- but it was during the week others they close at 10 or 11
[Daniel]:	It closes at 10 most nights except sunday
[Paola]:	Friday works for me as well (:
[Daniel]:	Sounds good, I mean we will likely work well into the evening so we can plan the time as like "after work" for now, is that cool? I would expect it to be 6 or 7
[Paola]:	6 or 7 should be fine. It is in Lombard right?
[Daniel]:	Yes i think so
[Daniel]:	Isn't that like super far from you?
[Paola]:	Well it's like 30min away from me. I have been there before. Only thing we would have to come back before 9 though because I do share cars with my mom and she works 3rd shift.
[Daniel]:	Well I don't really mind that at all. I could also drive just to make everything easier on your end, but I would also understand if you need to be home then regardless.
[Paola]:	Hey, I do have to apologize; I won't be able to make it tomorrow.
[Daniel]:	Oh no! seriously?
[Daniel]:	Well i guess we could possibly try something else some other time.
[Paola]:	Did you want for me to drop off your coffee at your car? Or would you want for me to take it and give it to you when we see each other?
[Daniel]:	Oops I forgot you had it
[Daniel]:	Is Diane here?
[Paola]:	Yes, and Pam also
[Daniel]:	Are you good to go now?
[Paola]:	Yes, I will leave 5 mins after you
[Paola]:	Como que Andrew esta en lonche? El estaba en su carro cuando llegamos nosotros?
[Daniel]:	I think he was leaving when we pulled in
[Daniel]:	I assume you have a ride home?
[Daniel]:	El regresaba a su casa
[Daniel]:	cierto o falso?
[Paola]:	I do, thank you!
[Paola]:	Muy cierto
[Daniel]:	bueno. tienes un bien noche
[Daniel]:	esta noche feminino o masculino?
[Paola]:	It is for both
		and I believe it is "Que pases buena noche"
[Daniel]:	Gracias
[Daniel]:	Ready for lunch?
[Paola]:	Just have to ship something real quick
[Daniel]:	I just got one at Best Buy, we can pick it up tomorrow 🙂
[Daniel]:	Is it snowing
[Paola]:	Really!? omg yes!
[Daniel]:	Esta novienda?
[Daniel]:	No wait
[Paola]:	Close!
[Daniel]:	esta nevando
[Paola]:	Yes, it is!
[Paola]:	Would you like for me to ask him when we can meet up so he can give you the disc
[Daniel]:	¿por que?
[Daniel]:	I just learned how to do upside down question makr
[Paola]:	lol Yeah, apparently those are used whenever is it a question.
[Paola]:	This could be our schedule for tomorrow's date:
		Pick me up( The most important lol)
		Call the guy
		Go to Best Buy
		Pick up cleaning supplies(if needed)(pls (:
		Pick up dinner
		Go home (:
[Daniel]:	Is Chris here?
[Paola]:	No, I haven't seen him
[Paola]:	A message was deleted in Google Chat (
		https://chat.google.com/dm/1ltWFwAAAAE
		).
[Daniel]:	Are we on today for lunch?
[Paola]:	Yes, once Pam comes in
[Paola]:	Actually she is here now
[Daniel]:	So you are ready I assume? I finishing someting up for andrew
[Paola]:	Don't worry take your time. I'll go after you.
[Daniel]:	You want to meet in back or I can pull the car around
[Paola]:	hmm maybe bring the car this time?
[Daniel]:	Sounds good to me
[Daniel]:	I just left
[Daniel]:	Let me know when you're off the phone
[Paola]:	I'm off
[Daniel]:	They're doing each others hair in the back right now ...
[Paola]:	Odd
		I shared "image.png" using the new Google Chat.
		Click here to view.
[Daniel]:	you /do/ like memes!
[Paola]:	I just found here face and thought it was funny
[Paola]:	Tell them they are suppose to be 6ft apart
[Daniel]:	Lol
[Daniel]:	let me know when Diane or Pam get here
[Daniel]:	Is Andrew in his office? He wanted to go over something with me before lunch 🫤
[Daniel]:	I am out front around the corner to the left. You probably can’t see me but I’m here :) take your time
[Daniel]:	Just kidding I went back around to the back because I forgot my lunch.
[Daniel]:	Give e like this seconds
[Daniel]:	Thirty
[Daniel]:	I’m back out front
[Daniel]:	I have never seen Andrew so angry I think.
[Paola]:	😕
[Paola]:	Problems with Aimtron?
[Daniel]:	Yeah, he was saying they're basically dodging our calls. Not a good situation to be in with our board supplier.
[Daniel]:	Hmm maybe just bubble from now on?
[Daniel]:	That was not a good look
[Paola]:	from Pam?
[Daniel]:	No for us, we looked bad
[Daniel]:	Less professional
[Paola]:	I agree
[Daniel]:	Fair enough. We can figure this out. Might be good to talk about it tonight.
[Daniel]:	Or some other time
[Paola]:	Oh no
[Paola]:	:/
[Paola]:	:c
[Daniel]:	Yeah ok, so we can probably do what we need to do in 45 minutes.
[Daniel]:	can you wait 15?
[Paola]:	Sure, take your time
[Daniel]:	Well you can also move my car to the back. That might help me slip out faster like I normally do. Plus I dont have to say "im going to a church meeting" in front of pam who now clearly knows I am not doing that haha
[Daniel]:	But you dont have to
[Paola]:	Haha I doubt she heard you. But I will move it to the back
[Daniel]:	Well like I said, you dont have to.
[Daniel]:	Almuerzamos?
[Paola]:	Deacuerdo
[Daniel]:	I just left. Pulling the car around now :) no rush
[Daniel]:	You never answered my question about tonight. And there is absolutely no pressure because I understand that you might need some space !
[Daniel]:	FYI andrew likes cheetos
[Paola]:	Hot cheetos!?
[Daniel]:	Hmm doesnt seem like it. He said he really likes the big bucket of cheese balls.
[Paola]:	About tonight, let me see how everything goes with my dad today when he picks me up from work. I will send you a txt and you can let me know if you will stay a little longer at work or if you end up leaving soon.
[Daniel]:	Happy St. Paddy's Day by the way!
[Daniel]:	If ever there was a day to get drunk ...
[Paola]:	Oh yeah its today! 
		Hopefully someday!
[Daniel]:	I mean what I am saying is that if ever we could get drunk its today. Because St. Paddys day is a drinking holiday.
[Paola]:	Oh, I had no idea honestly
[Daniel]:	Meh, a lot of American holidays are just an excuse to drink 🙂
[Daniel]:	But if you can find time tonight, I know what we can do, better dress for the bars!
[Daniel]:	Sounds like we do have cost friendly options for this hard drive recovery (officially what I am calling it)
[Paola]:	Truth is, Mexican holidays are also the same lol What if Nabeel wants to hang out with you tonight.. 
		(: Now I just hope the guy has the movie or wherever he has it.
[Daniel]:	Nabeel is in school rn, but I do have a possible meeting with his brother tonight. I am not trying to pressure you (although suddenly it seems like I am), I just wanted to offer a way to get me to drink :) I'll see you at lunch, yeah?
[Daniel]:	Also nabeel doesnt drink - but lets talk about that at lunch!
[Daniel]:	Can I ask you to wait for lunch until Andrew is out of this meeting? if you are hungry, you can either grab my keys or I can possibly leave now ...
[Paola]:	No worries. I will finish up some things as well
[Daniel]:	Itll be at least 5-10 mins
[Daniel]:	I am ready when you are
[Paola]:	I am ready as well
[Daniel]:	Time for lunch?
[Daniel]:	Have I got a story for you
[Paola]:	Yes
[Daniel]:	I’m out front
[Daniel]:	I would have written it on my own sticky note but I dont have any.
[Daniel]:	I will fix that...
[Paola]:	(: I wonder what color you chose.
[Daniel]:	Sorry for scaring you!
[Paola]:	Thank you for the note (:
[Daniel]:	Bubble me when you are done :)
[Paola]:	Yes (:
[Paola]:	done
[Daniel]:	I am glad he liked his gift, you will have to tell me how your family celebrates birthdays. So far all I know is that you like celebrating with the grinch!
[Paola]:	Yes! And don't worry we don't have to chat through here; we can talk during our lunch break. I don't want you to get in trouble.
[Daniel]:	Haha sure, that sounds good to me but I don't mind chatting some. Just felt like we got cut off early this morning :( I will see you for lunch !
[Paola]:	I agree with that. I felt the same way :c as always not enough time
[Paola]:	tu me manques
[Daniel]:	yo tambien
[Daniel]:	I love the way you lean back when you pass by me door haha
[Daniel]:	eres lindo
[Paola]:	What I sent you was actually in French
[Paola]:	according to google of course
[Daniel]:	Oh google , in school they taught us to not use google translate unless it was for like a single word at a time
[Paola]:	lol that is very true.
[Paola]:	Question, do you know if this > DHAB S/118 means it is a 350A current sensor?
[Daniel]:	Yes! you are correct!
[Daniel]:	Also I have some tea on Marisol I think you might be interested in hearing
[Daniel]:	I can probably take lunch right at noon if you are down
[Paola]:	Yes! Pam is here so I'm able to go also
[Paola]:	so you can spill tea
[Daniel]:	I am warming up the soup, I’ll let you know when I’m out front.
[Daniel]:	I am out front
[Daniel]:	That one never gets old :)
[Paola]:	70 degrees outside and in here it feels like 50🥲
[Daniel]:	Yeah, this room has an air sucker so I am getting the warm air in here right now 😎
[Daniel]:	Pulling it in from the open garage door
[Daniel]:	Wish you could come warm up in here for a little while
[Paola]:	🙁
[Paola]:	Don't be shy invite me
[Daniel]:	I just invited you. Its an official meeting
[Daniel]:	Check your email
[Daniel]:	You didnt come to my meeting 🙁
[Daniel]:	Do me a favor and have a wonderful rest of your day.
[Paola]:	🥲
[Daniel]:	Also tell your dad happy birthday for me, even if he doesn't know its coming from me :)
[Daniel]:	I see I am a bit too late. I am sorry :( the one day you wanted me there early. In my defense this guy likes to interview early. He's done that twice and I don't think Andrew or Chris likes it very much.
[Paola]:	Hi
[Daniel]:	Hey qt
[Daniel]:	I am a bit busy right now
[Paola]:	can we go for brunch?
[Paola]:	oh lol
[Paola]:	later then
[Daniel]:	I figured, can we wait just asmall bit?
[Paola]:	yes
[Daniel]:	Plus all the hens are clucking around that table right now
[Paola]:	lol that is true but not nice. Reason why I wanted to go before
[Daniel]:	Yeah that is probably our queue
[Daniel]:	cue?
[Daniel]:	cue.
[Daniel]:	Although the people have not yet returned to work and I am in no mood to socialize
[Daniel]:	I got the grumps 🙁
[Paola]:	:( not even with me?
[Daniel]:	Haha only with you
[Daniel]:	But no one else
[Paola]:	Pls
[Daniel]:	Right now?
[Paola]:	no one else
[Daniel]:	only a few ladies have yet to return
[Daniel]:	Had a great brunch!
[Daniel]:	Thanks for hanging out as always and I cannot wait for our little date tonight!
[Daniel]:	The cake I just ate had covid on it
[Paola]:	??
[Paola]:	How?
[Daniel]:	Did you get some?
[Daniel]:	It had like a little decorative reference to covid
[Daniel]:	Apparently Daniel likes to follow covid rules
[Daniel]:	Yo
[Daniel]:	I can leave whenever
[Paola]:	(:
[Paola]:	let me brb
[Daniel]:	What? are you leaving me?
[Daniel]:	I dont want to stay anymore
[Daniel]:	I do not mind taking an early lunch. Just let me know if that is what *you* want.
[Paola]:	I think 12 is fine. That way Pam is here also.
[Daniel]:	Oh that is right! I forgot that we gotta wait for someone to answer the phones.
[Paola]:	She will be coming in early today
[Daniel]:	Just tell me what you want to do then
[Paola]:	Lets go
[Daniel]:	I have to heat something up
[Daniel]:	I’m pulling around now, come out whenever.
[Daniel]:	My chips are gone. This call today will not solve all my problems :( \
[Paola]:	How are they gone ?? :(
[Daniel]:	Someone else bought them all
[Daniel]:	all 1k
[Daniel]:	But I do get to meet Carol (spelling?) tonight so I am still a happy guy 🙂
[Paola]:	:( I'm sorry to hear that. 
		But yes! I'm sure she will be nervous but excited to meet you as well! Also, don't worry if there are no blues. She might also like reds or light pinks. I'm sure those are more common.
[Paola]:	That way you are not that stressed
[Daniel]:	We went with bright purple and green ...
[Daniel]:	Should I change it?
[Daniel]:	its not too late
[Daniel]:	Deep purple
[Paola]:	hmmm maybe.. Not sure if she's a big fan of those colors
[Daniel]:	All set :)
[Daniel]:	I will try to come out and chat after the meeting 🙂
[Paola]:	Good luck! Hopefully everything goes well!
[Daniel]:	I got a phone!!
[Daniel]:	First , you have to connect your airpods to my phone
[Daniel]:	You can still hear?
[Paola]:	Yeah
[Paola]:	are you?
[Daniel]:	esta perfecto
[Daniel]:	Louder or quieter?
[Paola]:	Well when I get a phone call call I just take it out and then back in?
[Paola]:	um sir.. what happen to the music
[Daniel]:	I had to do something
[Daniel]:	I turned it back on
[Daniel]:	put your airpod in your ear and tell me when you did that
[Paola]:	oops
[Paola]:	I have it
[Paola]:	maybe a bit lower
[Daniel]:	Good now?
[Paola]:	Yes
[Daniel]:	What do you want?
[Paola]:	his top songs
[Daniel]:	SAyless
[Daniel]:	Sorry Andrew was talking to me
[Paola]:	I figured
[Daniel]:	This audio sharing has glitches
[Paola]:	That?
[Daniel]:	Haha did you pause it or what?
[Paola]:	yes?
[Daniel]:	Cause earlier it wasnt pausing and I think it was the way it should be.
[Daniel]:	Maybe not though
[Daniel]:	I guess we should be able to pause it like that
[Daniel]:	Anyway, I like this a lot
[Daniel]:	Also does this turn your volume down?
[Paola]:	I don't it pauses it because its only for a while then it plays again
[Paola]:	We should do a list of my fav songs and yours together and we can play them on shuffle
[Daniel]:	Hahaha we can totally do that. I have an idea for how we can do this.
[Daniel]:	I would honestly love to just listen to your music though, I don't really think you will like my music
[Daniel]:	Most people hate my taste (even though it is objectively good)
[Paola]:	Well I'm more than those people and I would love to listen to your favorites also
[Daniel]:	Haha its not like normal music but okay
[Paola]:	?? lol
[Daniel]:	I shared a note on iMessage that we can continually add to as we find songs or just think of one 🙂
[Daniel]:	Do you have a music service? I can share the playlist with you as well
[Paola]:	Yes, I see it 🙂
[Paola]:	yes? and sure
[Daniel]:	Apple music?
[Daniel]:	make it easy on me
[Paola]:	yes
[Daniel]:	Oh perfect
[Daniel]:	Then we dont even need the note right?
[Paola]:	I don't think so. If its easier by sharing the list
[Daniel]:	I just shared a playlist with you
[Daniel]:	it works?
[Paola]:	I only see one song?
[Paola]:	Is that right?
[Daniel]:	Yeah I didnt have time to actually make it I just wanted to do a little proof of concept
[Daniel]:	You see the picture?
[Paola]:	A little off the topic question, but what time will you leave to the airport today?
[Daniel]:	4:40
[Paola]:	So you are leaving early from work?
[Daniel]:	I am 🫤
[Daniel]:	So lunch was really it until Monday
[Paola]:	💔💔
[Paola]:	🥲 its ok
[Daniel]:	I know I am sorry, I will be back before you know it
[Daniel]:	I improved the playlist photo
[Paola]:	I didn't even see the camera lol
[Daniel]:	But you like it? I can change it if you want
[Daniel]:	You were in the process of trying tapping your ear to figure out why it wasnt working
[Daniel]:	Is the logo you use for your profile something that you drew?
[Paola]:	I found it online. But I am sure I can draw it exactly like that
[Daniel]:	Hawt
[Daniel]:	This album is weird
[Paola]:	I thought you were playing the radio
[Daniel]:	Haha right? its  really weird
[Paola]:	How about you switch
[Daniel]:	I am about to leave. I think we have to create that playlist like before monday because I cannot keep listening to this guy. He has some good songs but a lot of ones that are out there.
[Daniel]:	Try this one
[Daniel]:	I think its about us
[Paola]:	<33
[Paola]:	Fancy signature
[Daniel]:	Thank you I was trying to figure out why it doesnt work ... but it did hahaha
[Daniel]:	So unprofessional
[Daniel]:	I miss you in case you didn’t get my messages haha
[Paola]:	It's very sad to pass by your office and not see you there. Plus its dark.
[Paola]:	How are you though!? How is your family and the dog?
[Daniel]:	Good good, I’m more interested to hear about you!
[Daniel]:	Are upset I didn’t call?
[Paola]:	Well, you broke my heart once again lol. I'm not upset I understand you were probably tired plus you were with your brother. So it's totally fine.
[Paola]:	I'm sure we will have time to talk today or during the weekend.
[Daniel]:	Well I realized pretty quickly that I said I would call and I should have just done that. We are definitely talking today though.
[Daniel]:	I promise and I want my word to mean something (in spite of last night)
[Daniel]:	I honestly just miss you like crazy and want this time apart to be over.
[Paola]:	Yes! We can definitely talk today! Because I miss you as well! <3 I don't even want lunch time to come. What will I do for 30 mins lol
[Daniel]:	We can try to call then
[Daniel]:	Well like I said I can try to call (or you can try me as that would literally make my day) and if either of us is busy just decline the call. But I can all but guarantee I will answer.
[Daniel]:	I am logging off pretty lady! Have a good day and I can't wait to talk at noon!
[Paola]:	Oh, you mean call during lunch?
[Paola]:	I shared "image.png" using the new Google Chat.
		Click here to view.
[Paola]:	lol look what your bubble days
[Daniel]:	Yes absolutely, haha yes I made that so that no one tried to message me haha I also made that before I realized I would need to do some work.
[Daniel]:	I will miss you!
[Paola]:	Same here! Talk to you soon!
[Daniel]:	✌️
[Daniel]:	Good afternoon
[Paola]:	Not so good
[Paola]:	without you
[Daniel]:	Oh :( sad
[Daniel]:	I wish I could be there truly
[Daniel]:	Like I am working anyway
[Daniel]:	And I want to do that with you
[Paola]:	We for sure need our date Monday!
[Paola]:	Right after work
[Daniel]:	Yes, lets do that
[Daniel]:	You also okay if I come and see you for abit on SUnday?
[Daniel]:	I would really like that
[Paola]:	I would love that to! Let me see how everything goes that day with my parents. Because they will both be there. Unlike during the week.
[Daniel]:	Oh yeah that is totally understandable. I mean I dont even mean to really take you anywhere, just want to see that beautiful face and hear how your day was
[Daniel]:	Beats facetime anyway
[Paola]:	Sooo much better than facetime🥲
[Paola]:	Guess what!
[Daniel]:	Yeah, I guess that is all I wanted but I totally understand if its awkward or wouldn't be productive for your family.
[Daniel]:	WHAT??
[Paola]:	I will try my very best though (: 
		And this morning I had a little bit more of a conversation with my mom.
[Daniel]:	Paola that makes me so happy!!!
[Daniel]:	I am so glad to hear it
[Daniel]:	soy feliz
[Paola]:	I really wish things were like before at least with her. I would love to share with her everything about you.
[Paola]:	Because right now she knows nothing
[Daniel]:	Well, it is how it is and I know its terrible, but if I am around for five years, she will come around
[Daniel]:	She may even come to like me 😉
[Paola]:	That is true. All in due time. Reason why I think it should be good to not mention anything else about us at the fashion show.
[Daniel]:	Well the fashion show seems like 1. its something you and I can talk about at length and 2. maybe its something you should ask your sister about? she may have an objective opinion since she isnt like us with her emotions playing a role. plus she understands the situation better than anyone else (even me I bet)
[Paola]:	Ok, yes I agree! Then we can talk about it some other time before next weekend though!
[Daniel]:	Perfect, ask your sister first though
[Paola]:	Yes, I will when we have a date together this weekend
[Daniel]:	Perfecto, then we can have something extra to talk about sunday night if we see each other!
[Daniel]:	I am going to log off now 😢
[Paola]:	Take care and have fun!
[Paola]:	:(
[Daniel]:	Try not to miss me too much the rest of the day.
[Daniel]:	It is Friday after all
[Daniel]:	AND you will definitely hear from me tonight
[Paola]:	A challenge you to do the same lol
[Daniel]:	It honestly makes me think how badly we need to travel together
[Daniel]:	I know why we cant right now , but I will be hesitant to travel in the future until I know youre coming with me.
[Daniel]:	I guess I can keep messaging you on here on my phone
[Daniel]:	No issue for me, but for you ...
[Daniel]:	“Sent on iPhone” 👀
[Paola]:	Oh of course! We could travel to Glendale Heights, Campton hills or Naperville (:
[Paola]:	Yeah, for me its probably best through here.
[Daniel]:	Oh for sure! We are headed to get barbecue now
[Daniel]:	Lots of emails today?
[Paola]:	Sounds even better today that I'm not allowed to eat lol
[Daniel]:	Oh true I do feel bad I’m eating meat to be honest
[Paola]:	omg yass!😫 I leave the number below 200 everyday I leave and when I come back is close to 300
[Daniel]:	I am eating fish tonight though
[Daniel]:	That’s too many. How do you not get overwhelmed?
[Paola]:	Fried fish?
[Paola]:	And I do. My head is hurting actually
[Paola]:	but its almost time
[Daniel]:	Almost time to clock out?
[Paola]:	That is what I'm trying to make myself believe lol
[Daniel]:	Close enough! Is Chris out of the office?
[Paola]:	Yes, so is Andrew
[Daniel]:	lol what the heck? Chris said he’d be there
[Paola]:	He came back now
[Daniel]:	Oh nice maybe he’ll respond to my message🙄
[Daniel]:	But like when he’s not there do you just answer the phone by saying “have you sent an email yet?”
[Paola]:	Has he answered you?
[Paola]:	haha no, I answer all of them pretty much the same way.  But I do ask them that sometimes throughout the conversation.
[Daniel]:	No he’s probably busy or something haha
[Daniel]:	I figured I was just joking
[Daniel]:	Do you get a lot of similar calls?
[Daniel]:	Like what’s your most frequent inquiry?
[Paola]:	hahah
[Paola]:	he' s probably ignoring you
[Paola]:	I do actually
[Paola]:	and almost always...TECH
[Paola]:	-_- something I have no knowledge.
[Paola]:	But hopefully in the near future
[Daniel]:	You want to learn?
[Paola]:	Of course my customer service rating would be higher haha
[Daniel]:	I feel like our time together is more important than doing stuff like that but if it’s important to you I’d gladly help you out.
[Daniel]:	I think I shut down conversations about that a lot cause I don’t think you want to hear about it
[Paola]:	You actually do.. I thought you just didn't want to involve work in our conversations.
[Daniel]:	I’d rather be learning about you for sure
[Daniel]:	But like I said if it’s important to you than I’d gladly do it. We have a long time to learn about each other
[Daniel]:	I believe coffee gets delivered today so I will have a reason to come out and talk to you.
[Daniel]:	Also still cannot believe we havent done dinner
[Paola]:	Well we've had dinner
[Paola]:	just not outside
[Daniel]:	yes, but I think it would also be agood way to celebrate one month of dating.
[Daniel]:	Might have to take you downtown or something. Lets talk at lunch
[Paola]:	Yes! but, what about our date actual date?
[Daniel]:	I know that is why we have to talk at lunch 😆
[Paola]:	haha what I said didn't really make any sense
[Daniel]:	Well then I guess we know the topic for lunch. Especially considering our conversation from last night that never got concluded.
[Daniel]:	The real question is why is it so freaking cold in here??
[Paola]:	We honestly do have a lot of things to talk about. Also, did you start with the little notes that we will put together in the jar?
[Paola]:	Its cold here to :(
[Daniel]:	My thermostat reads 56
[Daniel]:	new low
[Daniel]:	I did not start with the jar cause I was pretty tired last night when I made it home
[Paola]:	Mine reads 50
[Paola]:	Its ok we have time
[Daniel]:	Should we call OSHA?
[Paola]:	Agree
[Daniel]:	Yeah we do have time . And I would kind of like to work on it together.
[Daniel]:	The thing is if we dont tell each other what we are putting in we will also get duplicates
[Paola]:	Yes, I would like to work on it together also. 
		hmm true... but its ok haha there will be exceptions remember?
[Daniel]:	Also I still feel like I dont really know you well enough to make good date ideas for you. Sorry to only bring up problems with this, but it might be good to do it fully together.
[Daniel]:	I am still totally on board for doing it lets just make sure we do it right
[Daniel]:	Like everything else in this relationship 🙂
[Paola]:	I am with you 🙂 can't wait for our date today.
[Paola]:	Are we going straight to Fox Valley after work?
[Daniel]:	That is fine with me. We dont want to run out of time shopping, right?
[Daniel]:	Also let me know if you want to listen to music
[Daniel]:	Right now the genre is rock but it can easily be switched
[Paola]:	Well, we sort of have limited time..
[Paola]:	Ok, I will let you know
[Daniel]:	Why? do I have to have you back before 11?
[Paola]:	Limited shopping time because the close at 7 I beleive
[Paola]:	believe*
[Daniel]:	Right, so yes, lets go to shop first
[Paola]:	Also, I'm very sorry missing your text

[Paola]:	Do you maybe know the answer to her/his question?
[Daniel]:	I gotchu
[Daniel]:	gimme like two minutes
[Daniel]:	The main IO has inputs of up to 16V (nominally 12V) for power. It also has outputs up to 3.3V. The thermistor inputs to the module are nominally 5V. Use outside of this range is not recommended as they have not been tested for that.
[Daniel]:	You might say "The power inputs have been tested with up to 16V, while the IO outputs have been tested up to 3.3V. The thermistor inputs have been tested up to 5V. We do not recommend usage outside of these ranges. Although if the need arises the wire gauge can be read off of the individual wire and referenced to the American Wire Gauge ratings."
[Daniel]:	WAIT
[Daniel]:	Don't say that. I will email you a better response
[Daniel]:	I just sent the email
[Paola]:	Your signature looks so fancy and professional
[Daniel]:	Can do lunch whenever you are ready
[Paola]:	but thank you!
[Paola]:	Yours vs mine

[Paola]:	Customers still don't care my signature says assistant they still think I'm able to answer their technical questions haha
[Daniel]:	How is that your title?
[Daniel]:	I should put my title
[Paola]:	Yes, agree
[Daniel]:	I dont really like my title
[Daniel]:	It sells me short
[Daniel]:	I REALLY dont like your title.
[Daniel]:	It definitely sells you short
[Paola]:	Agree (,:
[Paola]:	but it's temporary
[Daniel]:	Lunch??
[Paola]:	yes
[Daniel]:	I have to warm something up
[Daniel]:	I’m out front
[Daniel]:	How does this second half of the day go by so much slower whenever we have a date planned?
[Paola]:	😭😕
[Paola]:	2 1/2 more hrs
[Daniel]:	muy mal
[Paola]:	One more hour!
[Daniel]:	Yay :) you can have my keys if you want them
[Daniel]:	What did you ask me when you leaned in here?
[Paola]:	I'll leave when you leave (:
[Paola]:	Oh if you had a pen because I didn't want to ask the ladies for one
[Daniel]:	Oops
[Daniel]:	I did have one
[Daniel]:	You ready?
[Paola]:	I'm already outside
[Paola]:	and your car is locked
[Daniel]:	Less cold in here today :)
[Paola]:	can you give me a hug..
[Daniel]:	Yes of course but we will have to meet up somewhere ...
[Daniel]:	Well that took some time and I am still not done
[Daniel]:	Looks way better though
[Daniel]:	I can actually spread my elbows out
[Paola]:	Can't wait to see it!
[Paola]:	Is it better than mine?
[Daniel]:	Hahaha no
[Paola]:	help
[Paola]:	I shared "image.png" using the new Google Chat.
		Click here to view.
[Paola]:	pls
[Daniel]:	Not Andrew just grabbed me for something so I could be a bit before lunch
[Daniel]:	It controls the charge process but cannot perform the task of charging itself. You need an actual battery charger for that. The BMS tells the battery charger how much current and voltage to output during charge
[Daniel]:	Let me know if you need me to say that in an actual email format or if you understood that
[Paola]:	Thank you I think I understood
[Daniel]:	Let me know when you are ready for lunch
[Paola]:	At 12:15 should be ok?
[Paola]:	or no?
[Paola]:	nvm
[Daniel]:	What time works for you?
[Paola]:	12:25
[Daniel]:	Perfect, I need to warm something up. Do you need me to warm anything up for you?
[Paola]:	I think I'm good, thank you
[Daniel]:	Our front
[Paola]:	There is someone I would love for you to meet someday!
[Daniel]:	Huh?? Quien?
[Paola]:	Someone very very special to me
[Daniel]:	Oh well now I am very excited! I kinda thought I knew everyone like that in your life but this is very exciting.
[Daniel]:	We can talk about it after?
[Daniel]:	work?
[Paola]:	Sure
[Daniel]:	I think I am really going to cook for you tonight I swear! 😀
[Paola]:	🥳
[Paola]:	300 yrs later
[Daniel]:	🤕 ouch!!
[Paola]:	I'm playing (:
[Paola]:	I loved the pizza from yesterday!
[Daniel]:	I know, but I want to show that I am good for that, and hopefully get into it since I think cooking can be fun.
[Daniel]:	Especially if its for you :)
[Daniel]:	This meeting was supposed to be done 45 minutes ago...
[Daniel]:	I am working on something i can tell will go through five , Nordstrom closes at 8 but I don't want you to wait too long ... so just let me know when you are ready to go.
[Daniel]:	Or you can totally have my keys
[Daniel]:	Just let me know
[Daniel]:	this is going fast I foresee max 5 more minuts
[Paola]:	I can take your keys then (:
[Daniel]:	I am listening to the weeknd again
[Daniel]:	Gonna listen to every single one of his songs
[Paola]:	Some are not so good.
[Daniel]:	Haha yeah, but some are really good and I am shocked I had never heard them before.
[Daniel]:	Remind me next time I get donuts that people like the strawberry
[Paola]:	Do you remember the song from yesterday that I asked if it was the weekend?
[Paola]:	I will remind you (:
[Daniel]:	The one that sounded like him?
[Paola]:	But its not him
[Paola]:	?
[Daniel]:	I do not remember what it was called but I remember what it sounded like and it gave me great insight into the type of music you like
[Paola]:	Which song did you like the most?
		"Siendo Sincero" or "Soy el Unico"
[Daniel]:	I liked both, honestly, I am really enjoying getting to hear this music because I like all kinds of music and you've essentially been introducing me to an entirely new genre. So please continue doing that.
[Daniel]:	quieres almorzar?
[Daniel]:	I gotta heat up the soup too
[Paola]:	I can help

[Paola]:	btw look
[Daniel]:	I can't come until 1:30 🙁
[Paola]:	🙁
[Paola]:	I know
[Daniel]:	I want you to stay on the clock so that we can get the most time together
[Paola]:	Ok (:
[Paola]:	Are outside?
[Paola]:	are you*
[Paola]:	You know what else they will ask you for at the show - your mask.
[Daniel]:	Sounds good, I have a few or something
[Daniel]:	I can't believe you thought I wouldn't want to go
[Daniel]:	tonight
[Daniel]:	Unless you dont want me to go and were just being nice 👀
[Paola]:	Well, if I didn't want you to go then I would've probably never even brought it up in the first place
[Daniel]:	That is what I figured just wanted to make sure I wasn't intruding on girl time 💅
[Paola]:	Oh no don't worry. You will get to know my sister better also.
[Daniel]:	yep, I think its agreat idea
[Daniel]:	I just made my first email to a customer, andrew noted it was my first contact with a customer and said "good job"
[Daniel]:	🥲
[Paola]:	Congratulations! 🥳🥳 that deserves a price
[Paola]:	I wonder if in the future we will both be under a same email string.
[Daniel]:	Wow that would be interesting. What if someday you transfer a call over to me?!
[Paola]:	Trust me it be more than one
[Daniel]:	Let me know if you want my keys or something
[Daniel]:	I doubt I will have to stay very long after 5:00
[Paola]:	Don't worry I see my dad came to pick me up.
[Paola]:	I will see you later though right? Just remember they close at 7 🫤
[Daniel]:	Let me know how you like it
[Paola]:	I loved the heavy cream! Sugar, maybe a bit too much😄
[Paola]:	Do you know where I can find plastic bags here?
[Daniel]:	Fair enough with the sugar. I didnt realize how small the mug was especially once the cream was in there which I am sure has plenty of sugar as well
[Daniel]:	I will do better tomorrow if you actually did like it. I can also get you a travel mug if you really do want it more often
[Daniel]:	What size plastic bags? I know where to find garbage bags.
[Paola]:	Yeah I'm sure the heavy cream had some sugar also. But yes I really did like it (:
[Paola]:	Plastic bags to put envelopes inside so they won't get wet outside
[Daniel]:	Small garbage bag would work then , yeah?
[Paola]:	yes
[Paola]:	never mind
[Paola]:	haha
[Paola]:	they don't want them outside
[Daniel]:	Are we doing lunch today or are you not taking it?
[Paola]:	Yes, I will take lunch today
[Paola]:	I have a surprise for you
[Paola]:	sort of haha
[Daniel]:	WHAT?! I am excited
[Paola]:	Don't be haha
[Daniel]:	Hahaha well I am so deal with it
[Paola]:	What time is your meeting over?
[Daniel]:	I miss you, bummed we didnt get to talk more this morning
[Daniel]:	It is schedule to end at 10:30 😆
[Paola]:	I do to🙁but we'll see each other at lunch. Also, I washed the mug and left it over at the break room. Is that ok?
[Daniel]:	Haha I guess, its yours now. In the future I will take it from you
[Daniel]:	You drank that fast?
[Daniel]:	Did you actually like it?
[Paola]:	Well the hens might use it now cause it is over there
[Paola]:	I did, just a bit too sweet
[Daniel]:	Well hopefully not if I am in there every morning grabbing it for you
[Paola]:	Well they can grab it at lunch
[Daniel]:	True, we can keep it over here if we want, I think I am also gonna just get my own coffee
[Daniel]:	I like a darker roast and I want to see if you like it too
[Daniel]:	Also I think you may want a travel mug like Diane always has so that you don't spill on your computer
[Paola]:	hmmm.. I have no idea about coffee and true. I'll where I can get it from.
[Daniel]:	i LOVE coffee in case you couldn't tell but it can be a bit of a problem.
[Daniel]:	Like when your sister asks me whats my bad habit ....
[Daniel]:	This meeting is almost over 👏
[Daniel]:	Theyre talking busniess now
[Paola]:	If you don't tell me I think I would've never notice 🤔😄
[Paola]:	Do you talk to or are you just listening?
[Daniel]:	I guide discussion and they ask specifics
[Daniel]:	I try to make sure the salesman isnt just selling to us but is actually answering our general questions and they know exactly what they want so they respond on specifics. The more I do these though the better I am at directing our questions.
[Daniel]:	"they" is andrew and chris
[Daniel]:	I can explain better what they look like at lunch. But only if you tell me more about your work too
[Daniel]:	Will you be ready for lunch right at 12:00?
[Paola]:	no 🫤
[Paola]:	Maybe 12:15 or so
[Paola]:	Will you?
[Daniel]:	I am ready whenever you are and there is no pressure
[Paola]:	Ready
[Daniel]:	I know I am really sorry
[Paola]:	Its ok, I'll be outside
[Daniel]:	No wait I am not done yet 🙁
[Paola]:	ok (:
[Paola]:	I'll wait
[Daniel]:	I am pulling around
[Daniel]:	I have a record low 4 tabs right now
[Daniel]:	Why did lunch end so poorly? I am confused? What happened?
[Daniel]:	And don't worry about the first note, basically I dont want to feel like you did last friday.
[Daniel]:	Also thanks for the gift, was this the surprise? Cause I love it
[Daniel]:	a little too loud
[Daniel]:	do not play english music just because I am listening
[Paola]:	Sorry I will turn it down
[Paola]:	My list is on shuffle
[Daniel]:	You can control our volume separately by clicking the share icon when you swipe down from the top right
[Paola]:	Better?
[Daniel]:	You can turn it a little up lol sorry
[Paola]:	Now?
[Daniel]:	Esta perfecto
[Daniel]:	Me gusta esa cancion
[Paola]:	The one that finished?
[Daniel]:	si esta terminado
[Paola]:	Si, la que termino*
[Daniel]:	gracias
[Paola]:	thank you for my coffee
[Paola]:	te quiero
[Daniel]:	Haha yo tambien, pense a tu en la noche
[Daniel]:	Not really what I wanted to say
[Daniel]:	I dreamt of you
[Daniel]:	and I woke up with you running through my mind
[Paola]:	Soñe contigo anoche*
[Paola]:	But you have to tell me what you dreamed!
[Daniel]:	Right, I get that I needed to use that one but more importantly I was trying to say that because of the dream I couldnt stop thinking about you all morning
[Daniel]:	tuve sueno mal
[Paola]:	Well, now I really want to know the dream
[Paola]:	hi (:
[Daniel]:	malo?
[Daniel]:	no tuve suenos malos cuando estoy contigo
[Daniel]:	solamente cuando me duermo solo
[Paola]:	Ohhh, I see. I thought you meant you have a bad dream of me hahah
[Daniel]:	I did
[Paola]:	you had*
[Paola]:	?
[Daniel]:	es verdad
[Paola]:	I thought only when you were alone?
[Paola]:	Did your song stopped?
[Daniel]:	Right now I have bad dreams and I think its because of work but when I sleep with you I sleep better
[Daniel]:	Yes I did, habit
[Daniel]:	To listen to see if its andrew
[Daniel]:	But my bad dream last night was indeed about you 🙁
[Paola]:	🙁
[Daniel]:	I will tell you all about it at lunch and how I chose to interpret it.
[Daniel]:	And I would love to hear your interpretation if you're into that
[Paola]:	Of course! I really want to know
[Paola]:	Is this the first time?
[Daniel]:	tuve suenos en al pasado esos muy bueno pero me levanta de eso sueno por que estaba muy malo.
[Daniel]:	mal o malo???
[Paola]:	Well I would say 
		*Tube un mal sueño*
		If I say this---> Tasks to complete after inventory <-- 
		Does that make sense?
[Daniel]:	if you are making a list of things you need to after inventory then yes
[Daniel]:	but its not like a full sentence
[Daniel]:	I would usually just say "to do" and then make a to do list

[Paola]:	I shared "image.png" using the new Google Chat.

[Paola]:	It's a sheet I will share with Pam and Diane
[Daniel]:	Hmm if you are making a list of primarily text I would make a google doc and use the list function
[Daniel]:	Then you can say whatever you want unless you really like sheets
[Daniel]:	Sheets is more for math and data storage
[Daniel]:	Sorry that is beside the point my bad. You could just say "to do 4/1"
[Daniel]:	or "to do: 4/1/22"

[Paola]:	🙂
[Daniel]:	Very good, I just shared one with you that is a small tutorial on what is technically called an "outline"
[Paola]:	I see (: Thank you! I just shared it with them
[Daniel]:	Cool, I don't know much of that you wanted but it seemed like you got it. Google is such a powerful tool
[Daniel]:	I would be nothing if it wasnt for google

[Daniel]:	Not sure what he is missing the part number we have listed has six pins and so does the data logger display. The above links are purchase options, one from the OEM and one from a reseller
[Daniel]:	You can see for yourself , just google "molex 0050579406"
[Daniel]:	but make sure the numbers match exactly
[Paola]:	Wouldn't it be the same number for the basic? Since they are the same almost the same device? I just wasn't able to find the Specifications for the Basic Display
[Daniel]:	Oh my bad , I didnt read carefully enough
[Daniel]:	it is different gimme a second
[Daniel]:	https://www.molex.com/molex/products/part-detail/crimp_housings/0050579707
[Daniel]:	Ask andrew or chris if this is the right one
[Daniel]:	I don't want to tell them I am helping you with this
[Daniel]:	Wait on that
[Daniel]:	https://www.molex.com/molex/products/part-detail/crimp_housings/0050579407
		 Just kidding I think this is it
[Daniel]:	The part number is exactly the same but with a 7 instead of a 6 on the end
[Daniel]:	I dont think we will be eating lunch alone today
[Paola]:	🙁 we can just take a slice and leave
[Daniel]:	Hmm not sure itll be like that but we can easily play it by ear
[Daniel]:	I can also give you my cooler full of chinese food so you can eat later
[Daniel]:	Last time I had pizza for lunch we all sat around the conference table
[Daniel]:	and ate together
[Paola]:	hmm how long ago?
[Paola]:	Before covid?
[Daniel]:	Well before covid haha
[Daniel]:	I guess technically only like 6 or 7 months but yaeh before covid
[Daniel]:	Lol do you like eminem?? I love it.
[Paola]:	haha yes
[Daniel]:	I know every word
[Paola]:	thats is my fav song i think
[Daniel]:	by him or in general?
[Paola]:	by him
[Daniel]:	Ah I see
[Daniel]:	GREAT SONG
[Daniel]:	You like glass animals?
[Paola]:	😁
[Daniel]:	I think we should get pizza while its hot
[Paola]:	Ok
[Daniel]:	Unless you are busy of course
[Paola]:	We can go now
[Daniel]:	I can give you the chinese food before you leave
[Daniel]:	I don't know what I was thinking when I got that coffee. I easily could have known you wouldn't like it
[Daniel]:	Don't feel like you have to finish it
[Paola]:	It isn't bad at all! It's just stronger
[Paola]:	And sweet! Which makes it good
[Daniel]:	Hmm I don't believe you cause I remember the face you made when you drank it
[Daniel]:	I want to try different coffees with you cause I like them all so we can find one that you like too.
[Paola]:	Well because it is very different what I would normally drink.
[Daniel]:	Hmm It is bolder and more bitter which I know you do not like. I think we should try a lighter roast. Do you like savory and sweet?
[Daniel]:	Like salted caramel and chocolate or pretzel m&ms?
[Daniel]:	sabroso y dulce
[Paola]:	I honestly don't know either haha maybe yes a lighter roast?
[Daniel]:	I cannot wait for lunch today
[Daniel]:	I am excited for shrimp
[Daniel]:	And I did remember to bring tea
[Paola]:	Me too! I love shrimp!
[Daniel]:	Is Pam here yet?
[Paola]:	No 🙁
[Daniel]:	Oh I thought I heard someone come in through the frint
[Daniel]:	front
[Paola]:	hmm a ghost?
[Paola]:	hahha
[Paola]:	its just me
[Paola]:	here
[Daniel]:	Did you see any ghosts then?
[Daniel]:	Maybe the one from my apartment last night?
[Daniel]:	Could be following you like in veronica
[Paola]:	Well I can't see them but I'm sure they can see me
[Daniel]:	I heard that ... another ghost?
[Paola]:	hahaa Pam is here
[Paola]:	or is it a ghost?
[Daniel]:	I got bugs 🐞
[Daniel]:	Are you good to leave at noon? I can pull the car around like now
[Paola]:	Yes
[Daniel]:	Ok, I will do it.
[Daniel]:	I’m out front
[Daniel]:	There are all sorts of ghosts coming in and out of that door today
[Paola]:	I'm getting a little bit scared
[Paola]:	I shared "image.png" using the new Google Chat.

[Paola]:	Do you understand what he wants
[Daniel]:	He wants a IO connector
[Daniel]:	He has a JR2 or O2?
[Daniel]:	It doesnt matter , it will just be the Main IO wiring harness for his respective BMS
[Paola]:	Well, the Main IO are different for J2 and O2
[Daniel]:	Yes, so whichever BMS he has you get him that one.
[Daniel]:	Evidently he also wants it in 12 ft which I don't really see on our website but I didnt look very hard (clearly he didnt either)
[Paola]:	Well, to my understanding we don't have a 12ft. And if Falcon Electric can't provide it for him, we can possibly do a custom Main I/O
[Daniel]:	Sounds like you know your answer then
[Daniel]:	You are smart
[Daniel]:	And its hawt
[Paola]:	Of course! You were still doubting? 😮
[Daniel]:	Haha that face . Wait so you know we dont sell 12 foot main IO or you are just taking my word for it?
[Daniel]:	Cause I didnt shop very hard on our website and I want you to be certain before you tell this guy to go buy somewhere else
[Paola]:	I'm sure we don't sell that.
[Daniel]:	Did chris just have an interview??
[Paola]:	+ I already told him to try shopping at Walmart. They might have what he is looking for. Or Costco they have big pallets over there.
[Daniel]:	"Amazon has everything"
[Daniel]:	Me and the bugs are getting friendly
[Paola]:	I think his meeting was about insurance. That's what the guy told me.
[Paola]:	Noooo you can't be friendly with anyone else but me
[Daniel]:	Hmm ok, I will elbow them like you do
[Daniel]:	In the lab me and andrew like to say "bug meet boot" and then we kick the bug
[Paola]:	Bless you
[Daniel]:	Thanks haha my allergies are bad today
[Paola]:	:(   Do you take anything for that?
[Daniel]:	Its called Xyzal but I took one this morning and it didnt really seem to help 🙁
[Daniel]:	🤧
[Daniel]:	^ me
[Paola]:	Do you need tissues? :c
[Daniel]:	Haha I have just been making frequent trips to the bathroom to blow my nosr
[Daniel]:	Sorry about that
[Paola]:	?
[Daniel]:	But THANK YOU for the banana
[Daniel]:	It was awkward
[Daniel]:	And I kinda knew andrew would be back soon
[Paola]:	It was unexpected for me haha
[Paola]:	But he is gone now
[Daniel]:	I know but you played it well
[Daniel]:	"I had a question"
[Daniel]:	SURRRE
[Daniel]:	That caramel was bad though
[Paola]:	You think so hahha
[Paola]:	I do have questions though that I'm you can help instead of me bothering Andrew
[Paola]:	I told you it wasn't good
[Daniel]:	So like did you used to message him and ask him all those questions youve been asking me lately?
[Daniel]:	And you were right
[Paola]:	Not really. Unless it involved pricing and quotes
[Paola]:	and/or
[Daniel]:	Wait then how did you answer those types of emails?
[Daniel]:	Also I do not like this meeting anymore . I am going to look for a group that meets in the morning before work.
[Daniel]:	Eh wait that wouldn't help us if we had a late night 🫤
[Paola]:	You still have meetings on Mondays?
[Daniel]:	Yeah that is the only reason I am not asking you to hang out tonight
[Daniel]:	I may have said they were done but then I got an email that said they were going to continue to meet and I must have forgot to tell you.
[Paola]:	Ahhh I see :( Well it's ok we will still see each other tomorrow
[Daniel]:	Agreed I am just saying I think I might look for a group that doesn't eat into my evenings. For both you and for work.
[Daniel]:	And other things. Like I am up almost every morning working out anyway. I don't necessarily NEED to work out 7 days a week
[Paola]:	That is true. But at least the meetings are just once a week. Aren't they?
[Daniel]:	Yeah, I would also love to have a conversation about this in the context of what I mentioned last night about switching churches.
[Daniel]:	But that is definitely an in-person conversation
[Paola]:	Conversation for our date tomorrow then (:
[Daniel]:	For sure :) enjoy your evening and I will text you later tonight I am sure
[Daniel]:	I am confused why you asked for a hug and then walked away??
[Paola]:	I thought it might've been too risky?
[Daniel]:	Fair enough
[Daniel]:	Theres plenty of time to hug later 🙂
[Paola]:	Agree, I would just feel really bad if you ever got in trouble because of me
[Daniel]:	And I feel the same way about you. But it still nice to get an unexpected hug, we can just ensure no one sees it, yeah?
[Paola]:	on my way!
[Daniel]:	How's the coffee?
[Daniel]:	And thanks for that i really wasn't actually expecting it
[Paola]:	I think I really like it because of the cream
[Paola]:	I liked it. I hope we can do it more often. Next time we can just close the door
[Daniel]:	Hmm it was nice but we should set up some boundaries on that. We can talk tonight or at lunch?
[Paola]:	I was playing though. It is still risky
[Daniel]:	Oh I didn't realize you were joking. At any rate, we should probably address this at some point soon.
[Paola]:	Do you know what I can do for my computer to not be slow? :c It's acting lazy. Could that be a bug?
[Daniel]:	I can come look at it . It will likely have to do with how many programs you have running and how "heavy" they are.
[Daniel]:	Also how many tabs you have open (should be <15)
[Paola]:	14 tabs
[Paola]:	and 5 on another one
[Daniel]:	Are you ready for lunch? I will come look at your computer in a second then go warm up the chinese food.
[Paola]:	Sure, I told Diane I will go to lunch around 12:25
[Daniel]:	Thanks for rudely interrupting me and Chris' quality time !! 😡
[Daniel]:	Just kidding
[Paola]:	You're welcome
[Daniel]:	I thought he was gonna tell you to take that sales pitch earlier, but he clearly just wanted that person out of the building.
[Daniel]:	45 minutes 😀
[Daniel]:	Talk to me girlfriend
[Daniel]:	When do you want to leave"
[Daniel]:	?*
[Paola]:	In 10mins?
[Daniel]:	I can tell you're busy so take all the time you need
[Daniel]:	If we delete this chat we will never be able to show them how us being together works to their advantage.
[Daniel]:	We need to do more research on office romances.
[Paola]:	Hmmm agree
[Daniel]:	How is the coffee this morning?
[Paola]:	The more I have coffee this strong the more I'm starting to like it actually haha
[Paola]:	Also, look (: my turn please.

[Daniel]:	Y a que hora?
[Daniel]:	Lunch?
[Paola]:	Yes (:
[Daniel]:	I’m warming up your soup
[Daniel]:	I’m out front
[Paola]:	: D
[Daniel]:	Rosa just had a heart to heart with me
[Paola]:	?
[Daniel]:	A conversation where she told me very personal things
[Daniel]:	Apparently she's not getting good sleep
[Paola]:	Oh 🫤 hope she's doing well
[Daniel]:	She started crying saying yesterday was so bad that she didnt want to work anymore.
[Daniel]:	She said shes doing better today
[Daniel]:	She said that our conversation gave her more energy
[Paola]:	🙁 aww I'm glad you were able to have that conversation with her.
[Daniel]:	Yeah, I was really glad I was there too. Seems like maybe we are closer than I thought. Honestly when she started talking to me I thought she was going to ask about you seeing as we just got out of the car and she was right there.
[Daniel]:	But anyway , I hope you have what you need now and let me know if you need anything else.
[Paola]:	Question, if a customer needs 2000A current sensors and we don't have them, is there a way they can use the ones we have and make it up to 2000A?
[Paola]:	Isn't the dual current sensors?
[Daniel]:	Still want me to help with this? I’m ready when you are.
[Daniel]:	I’m working on something will be out in a bit
[Paola]:	Take your time (:
[Daniel]:	So should I even heat up the steak?
[Daniel]:	Or the mac and cheese?
[Paola]:	Maybe just the steak?
[Daniel]:	haha I gotchu
[Daniel]:	Is Pam here?
[Paola]:	yes
[Daniel]:	And if so are you ready?
[Daniel]:	I’ll go heat everything up
[Daniel]:	I’m out front
[Daniel]:	If you actually couldnt talk after I jinxed you, would we be waiting for someone to say maria or paola? 🤔
[Paola]:	Interesting.. I didn't know those were the rules
[Daniel]:	Well I think the rules vary somewhat
[Paola]:	We would say " jinxed triple you owe me 3 sodas"
[Daniel]:	Hahaha I have played the soda thing before but no one actually gets the sodas
[Daniel]:	Waiting until someone says your name is more fun because it may actually happen sooner or later
[Daniel]:	There are different variations on what is required of the jinxee. A report in 1973 described that the loser should remain silent until they are freed by the winner. [4] In another, the winner will say, "Jinx, buy me a soda" or "pinch poke, you owe me a Coke" first and the loser must comply.[5] There is also a version where the name of the jinxee has to be uttered a number of times to "free" the jinxee.[citation needed]
[Daniel]:	from wikipedia
[Paola]:	That is true. Till this day I haven't received my sodas hahah.
[Paola]:	They are all similar in some way
[Paola]:	How about we switch it a little. You owe me a hug now.
[Daniel]:	Ok, and when you jinx me?
[Daniel]:	let me know if you need to flex lunch time at all
[Paola]:	Pam will not be in today. So we can take lunch at any time. I will let Diane know
[Paola]:	Looks like Diane would like for me to take lunch at 12
[Daniel]:	Then I will go heat everything up
[Daniel]:	Sorry about that. I could tell I wasn't going to know what he was talking about haha
[Daniel]:	But YOU did
[Daniel]:	You impress me every day with how smart you are.
[Daniel]:	AND I loved working with you.
[Paola]:	I'm really sorry. But thank you for helping me with his call.
[Paola]:	We make a great team!
[Paola]:	I will teach you more about that chart. It is very helpful!
[Daniel]:	They got me running a tester in the production room
[Daniel]:	Help me
[Paola]:	How?
[Daniel]:	I’m just joking
[Daniel]:	Just bored lol how’s the latter half of your day going 😆
[Paola]:	hahah well... Justin just called again
[Daniel]:	Oh shoot
[Daniel]:	Did he ask about the same thing?
[Daniel]:	And did you tally up all the hugs I owe you?
[Paola]:	Yeah sort of
[Paola]:	Yes, remember the drawer I showed you, the one that's organized? Each piece of paper is a hug
[Daniel]:	😲
[Daniel]:	Ok, well then we have to hang out tonight
[Daniel]:	So I can start repaying all those
[Daniel]:	I trust you were able to handle justin this time around?
[Paola]:	Of course (:
[Paola]:	Also look,
[Paola]:	I shared "image.png" using the new Google Chat.

[Daniel]:	Walter is rude
[Daniel]:	Can't belive you deal with that all day
[Paola]:	He is nice compare to others
[Paola]:	compared*
[Daniel]:	Well you provided a great answer to his question and the thing is , he can do it by himself so why is he asking us for help?
[Daniel]:	Just trying to get out of doing work.
[Paola]:	Hahah I had the same question. It would've been an email less
[Daniel]:	Indeed, and one less head ache . truly trul have mad respect for you for being able to deal with people with such patience.
[Daniel]:	Hey you
[Daniel]:	Have a good time with your mom
[Paola]:	Thank you (:
[Paola]:	I will ask for permission for today
[Daniel]:	Okie
[Daniel]:	Just let me know
[Daniel]:	And when, I can plan when I leave work and what not
[Daniel]:	I know this may not be totally welcome, but I would still love to take my lunch with you   🙂
[Paola]:	I will see you at lunch (:
[Paola]:	te quiero
[Daniel]:	yo te quiero mas . we will make it through this.
[Paola]:	Yes we will. We are in this together and we will find a solution that will work for both of us.
[Daniel]:	Timing?
[Paola]:	12:15
[Daniel]:	Sure, I am ready whenever so just let me know when you are also ready
[Paola]:	I'm ready
[Daniel]:	I’m out front
[Paola]:	Pam went to brb
[Daniel]:	investigue nuestros relacion en el contexto de la oficina. vamos a hablar esta noche.
[Paola]:	Tengo miedo
[Daniel]:	No necessitas tener miedo. esta bien por que lo hacemos juntos.
[Paola]:	5 more mins!
[Daniel]:	:D you want to leave right at five? fine with me.
[Daniel]:	Just making sure
[Paola]:	yes
[Paola]:	(:
[Daniel]:	me gusta mucho tu pelo . estoy triste por que te no hablo en persona
[Daniel]:	en persona?
[Daniel]:	but I am excited to be able to chat again
[Daniel]:	I missed you on here yesterday
[Paola]:	"...por que no hablamos en persona"
[Paola]:	I missed you too. I was sad also
[Daniel]:	gracias
[Paola]:	first time I felt you distant
[Daniel]:	🙁 well here's to not letting that happen as much if ever.
[Daniel]:	Practiced 4 spanish lessons today
[Daniel]:	quiro estar listo por tus padres
[Paola]:	Yo tambien te quiero ayudar.
[Paola]:	En lonche me enseñas que aprendiste
[Daniel]:	No aprendia mucho pero practica mucho frases de la familia
[Daniel]:	es mejor que a practicar contigo
[Paola]:	Habalamos solo español hoy?
[Paola]:	Para que tengas mas practica?
[Daniel]:	Si cuando almorzamos? o en la oficina?
[Daniel]:	muchas cosas son mas complejas y no apprendo como decir
[Paola]:	Si, cuando almorzemos.
[Paola]:	Paso a paso. Yo voy a estar ahi para ayudarte.
[Daniel]:	nuestros estamos un equipo
[Paola]:	Btw! Tengo otra idea mas que me gustaria agregar a nuestra lista de citas..
[Daniel]:	mando mis padres un mesaje ahora
[Daniel]:	por el fin de semana
[Daniel]:	este el fin de semana

[Paola]:	respondido*
[Daniel]:	no, es falso. ses mando y no rosponden
[Daniel]:	responden
[Daniel]:	les mando?
[Paola]:	Si, puedes mandarle un mensaje?
[Daniel]:	si en mi telefono??
[Daniel]:	no apprendo
[Paola]:	No entiendo
[Daniel]:	I keep confusing those two
[Daniel]:	lo siento solo en espanol
[Paola]:	Well "no aprendo" is "I don't learn" and "no entiend" is "I don't understand"
[Daniel]:	Si tu estas correcto. Yo apprendo espanol y no entiendo como tu eres mas bonita en cada dia.
[Paola]:	Muy buen ejemplo! Te quiero mucho
[Paola]:	Hoy me levante a las 7:55
[Paola]:	no estoy bonita
[Daniel]:	COMO??? Tu pelo es muy elegante y no tienes tiempo por lo trabajar
[Paola]:	"no tienes tiempo por lo trabajar" ?
[Daniel]:	you didnt have time to work on it
[Paola]:	No, no tube tiempo 🙁
[Paola]:	tuve*
[Daniel]:	pero es muy bonito . necesito dos horas en la manana estar listo
[Paola]:	Tu necesita 2 horas?
[Daniel]:	me levanto a las seis algunas veces y no dejo por dos horas
[Daniel]:	me levanto a las siete hoy
[Paola]:	O por eso llegaste tarde?
[Daniel]:	Andrew is coming to you
[Daniel]:	Should I tell andrew that we are dating?
[Paola]:	maybe not yet
[Daniel]:	He's gonna be like "we figured"
[Paola]:	I think I was way to close to you
[Paola]:	today
[Paola]:	when they came in
[Daniel]:	Us
		I shared "IMG_4210.JPG" using the new Google Chat.
		Click here to view.
[Paola]:	Something like that😂😂
[Daniel]:	I think you might like the office but I don't think we have time for it in our lives right now. Very funny show esp. because we have an office romance.
[Paola]:	Don't be shy we can watch it when we are married. That could be our after work show.
[Daniel]:	Chris go ⚡
[Daniel]:	For absolutely no reason 😆
[Paola]:	Quieres almorzar conmigo?
[Daniel]:	Si ahora?
[Paola]:	Si, en cinco minutos
[Daniel]:	Hago la comida caliente
[Daniel]:	Estoy en frente de la oficina
[Daniel]:	I am getting nervous to talk to andrew
[Paola]:	I am nervous for you also
[Paola]:	and me when he sees me
[Daniel]:	At least I can count on Marisol coming in from outside just now
[Paola]:	?
[Daniel]:	I just heard the door open sound and watched her walk in 😆
[Daniel]:	Like I described at lunch
[Paola]:	Oh hahaa I'm telling you
[Daniel]:	Either way ... 🙏
[Paola]:	Do you want to let Andrew know tomorrow?
[Daniel]:	Why?
[Daniel]:	what good does that do?
[Daniel]:	He seems to be in a good mood today, I don't want him to be stressed tomorrow or something. I will feel it out though
[Paola]:	Ok cause I know things are tough now
[Paola]:	even with Diane not being here
[Daniel]:	Ok, I could see that. I will just feel it out then. I think I am doing well over here and he likes what we are working on. On Sunday he said "good work" in chat.
[Paola]:	I'm glad to hear that! (:
[Paola]:	Let me know how things go then.
[Daniel]:	Well of course I will
[Daniel]:	I told him
[Daniel]:	If anything he was excited for us
[Paola]:	.....
[Daniel]:	??
[Paola]:	he left pretty fast
[Daniel]:	I told him earlier
[Paola]:	ok now I'm shy
[Daniel]:	Like before I left the lab to talk to crhis
[Daniel]:	Don't be he was seriously excited
[Daniel]:	He said "congratulations"
[Daniel]:	All I said is that we had been going out and I wouldn't bore him with any details
[Paola]:	Did you tell him the positive reason haha
[Daniel]:	No, I can do that later. I didnt want to defend it right after I told him. That looks guilty. But now at some point I can be like "Maria asked me this question" so that he understands we are symbiotic for the company.
[Daniel]:	symbiotic means mutually beneficial
[Paola]:	Do you have more heavy cream here?
[Daniel]:	f course
[Daniel]:	Its in the fridge
[Paola]:	I will take some then (:
[Daniel]:	You want me to go grab it for you?
[Daniel]:	Or you going to do it yourself?
[Paola]:	Yo puedo ir (:
[Daniel]:	si tu quieres
[Paola]:	Pues no pero ya que
[Daniel]:	yo puedo si quieres
[Daniel]:	no me llaman
[Paola]:	No quiero que tengas problemas
[Paola]:	Ahorita paso y me sirvo
[Daniel]:	No hay ningún problema.
[Daniel]:	Pero si tu quieres
[Daniel]:	tu estas muy muy bonita este dia. no creo como bonita.
[Daniel]:	Mmm maybe not what I meant to say lol
[Daniel]:	"I like you a lot" 🤭
[Paola]:	Pero me quieres?🙂
[Daniel]:	Si te quiero mucho. No quiero esperar por la noche a quitarte la ropa 😏 en ingles: "I want you"
[Paola]:	😂 PG-13 porfavor
[Daniel]:	Just a heads up I am working on something that I need to finish before lunch. Its a bug and often these things take time to fix.
[Paola]:	No problem at all. I will leave for lunch once you're outside.
[Daniel]:	Gonna be at least 10 minutes from now
[Daniel]:	Did Andrew leave?
[Paola]:	yes
[Daniel]:	OK, cool I am warming stuff up then.
[Daniel]:	do I loop you in on this email?
[Daniel]:	Like reply all?
[Daniel]:	Chris wants you to forward it to me
[Paola]:	Ok, I forward the email to you.. BUT I also did some research and it looks like he did not purchase his unit from us which means if he purchased from a reseller they will be best suited to provide him with tech suppot. So I think we should wait to see what he comes back with.
[Paola]:	If he's upset he might not even come back
[Daniel]:	I assume Chris told you this? send them back to reseller.
[Paola]:	No, but that is usually what I would do first before sending it for tech support
[Daniel]:	Oh chris is telling me not to answer it lol
[Daniel]:	He told me almost exaclty what you told me
[Paola]:	Don't be shy snip it over to me
[Daniel]:	You want to use it in response? I can read it in the car tonight
[Daniel]:	after work
[Daniel]:	quiero ir contigo ahora
[Paola]:	Aqui esta tu patron
[Daniel]:	mi jefe? el es en su oficina
[Paola]:	Tu otro jefe
[Daniel]:	Mi jefe no esta en el laboratorio y necessito hablar con el. es possible vamos despues de cinco.
[Paola]:	No te preocupes
[Daniel]:	5 minutes
[Daniel]:	legit
[Paola]:	(: tomate tu tiempo
[Paola]:	yo mientras trabajo tambien
[Daniel]:	I’m sorry I didn’t really see this :/
[Daniel]:	No rush
[Daniel]:	me afeito esta noche o manana?
[Daniel]:	debo afeitarme esta noche?
[Paola]:	Hoy, yo te quiero acompanar
[Daniel]:	Bueno y despues de vamos a ducharnos juntos ?
[Paola]:	Es exactamente lo que te iba decir.
[Daniel]:	Bueno estoy muy emocionado
[Paola]:	Yo tambien! Pero primero de compras y despues nos duchamos?
[Paola]:	Tambien te queria decir, mi mama dijo que hoy no podiamos comer carne tampoco.
[Paola]:	Por que es la semana mayor
[Daniel]:	te quiere comer pescado o no podemos comer carne por lo general?
[Daniel]:	Primero compramos en dos o tres tiendas
[Daniel]:	necesitamos a comprar*
[Paola]:	Es que el pescado no es mi favorito.
[Paola]:	I shared "image.png" using the new Google Chat.

[Daniel]:	pero te gustan las camarones?
[Daniel]:	las son pescados
[Daniel]:	OYE
[Daniel]:	Tengo pollo por almorzar
[Paola]:	https://c.tenor.com/wXyvmX1gAy0AAAAC/omg-barbie.gif
[Paola]:	Que tal guacamole?
[Daniel]:	Si yo tengo
[Paola]:	Eso esta bien (:
[Daniel]:	vamos a comprar queso tambien
[Daniel]:	y usamos los cheetos con el queso
[Paola]:	Queso deretido?
[Daniel]:	Si en ingles se llama solo queso
[Daniel]:	por que es queso mexicano
[Paola]:	Ahh entiendo. Si esta bien lo compramos (:
[Paola]:	oye!
[Daniel]:	Si?
[Paola]:	Que cres que le compre a mi hermana por su graduacion?
[Daniel]:	se voy a comprar las flores?
[Paola]:	Pero yo quiero comprarle algo y no se que
[Daniel]:	o una cosa especialmente
[Daniel]:	no supe que dijiste pero ya entiendo (did I use "ya" right?).  Te ayudo pensar de also
[Daniel]:	algo*
[Paola]:	Si porfavor
[Paola]:	Ella se va graduar en Mayo
[Paola]:	y el dia de las madres es en Mayo tambien
[Daniel]:	te gusta a dar los regalos, si?
[Paola]:	Lo hago cada año
[Paola]:	Pero cuando yo estaba chiquita, realmente no podia darles nada mas que una carta o un dibujo.
[Daniel]:	En mi familia es mejor que pasar tiempo con mi madre. No la doy muchos regalos
[Daniel]:	Si en tu jovenes es muy dificil a hacer dinero
[Daniel]:	te ayudo pensar de las cosas
[Daniel]:	am i sayingthat right? it seems awkward?
[Daniel]:	te voy a ayudar pensar de las cosas?
[Paola]:	Ah interesante! Cuando es el dia de las madres para ustedes?
[Paola]:	haha I understood but maybe you could say "te ayudo a pensar en algo?"
[Paola]:	or "Yo te puedo ayudar a pensar en algo"
[Daniel]:	si necesito usar "poder" mas y mas.
[Daniel]:	el dia de la madre es el domingo en mayo
[Daniel]:	no recuerdo exactamente
[Daniel]:	pero el cumpleanos de mi madre es en dos semanas
[Paola]:	Sabes que dia lo celebramos nosotros?
[Paola]:	Que dia es el cumpleanos de tu madre?
[Daniel]:	celebras en mismo dia de nosotros
[Daniel]:	5/8 este ano
[Daniel]:	y el cumpleanos de mi madre es en 4.27
[Paola]:	No, nostros lo celebramos el  10 de Mayo.
[Daniel]:	por que?
[Daniel]:	Google dija no
[Paola]:	Me imagino que asi esta en el calendario Mexicano
[Paola]:	I shared "image.png" using the new Google Chat.

[Paola]:	a mi me dijo que si
[Daniel]:	mis hermanos llaman mi madre pero mi hermana loca probablamente no se llama
[Daniel]:	asi siempre en el dies de mayo
[Daniel]:	diez lo siento
[Paola]:	Lo siento mucho. Ojala tu hermana cambie y algun dia aprenda a volorar a tus padres.
[Paola]:	Podemos ir a un lugar donde me gustaria comprarle flores a mi madre?
[Daniel]:	cuando?
[Daniel]:	y por supuesto
[Daniel]:	esta pam aqui?
[Paola]:	Buena pregunta
[Paola]:	Si, ya llego
[Paola]:	cuando puedes ir a lonche?
[Daniel]:	cuando quieres
[Paola]:	En 10 minutos?
[Daniel]:	esta bueno
[Paola]:	Esta bien*
[Paola]:	"For a quantity of 6-40 units there is a lead of 12-25 weeks. If quantity 5 or less lead time is 4-12 weeks."

[Daniel]:	Sounds good to me, use commas maybe?

[Paola]:	Si! Me encanta
[Daniel]:	es por que tengo magia
[Daniel]:	recuerdas mi cuarto??
[Daniel]:	hace viento in case you were wondering
[Daniel]:	That is what they taught us in school anyway
[Paola]:	Si no me dices, no me doy cuenta
[Daniel]:	dos y media horas :D
[Paola]:	Dos horas y media*
[Paola]:	Estoy emocionada
[Daniel]:	Don't be shy share your music with me
[Paola]:	Don't be shy ven pues

[Paola]:	This means they will use it in an aircraft right?
[Daniel]:	JRs
[Paola]:	-_-
[Daniel]:	Lol my bad, I didnt see your question, no pilot means like "first try" here.
[Daniel]:	In fact they say it is stationary energy storage
[Paola]:	Tu te desconectaste?
[Daniel]:	Si por que mi "ear bud" no tenga energia
[Daniel]:	Do you think you will be ready at five?
[Daniel]:	I cannot confirm or deny whether or not I will be to be honest
[Paola]:	Its ok
[Paola]:	Can you unlock your car though, pls c:
[Daniel]:	I can do you one better and give you the keys :D
[Daniel]:	Don't worry I am still tryna leave at five
[Paola]:	Come talk to me😩
[Daniel]:	But obviously if you already talked to her you can leave it as is
[Daniel]:	Andrew just looked back at me while I was standing in the doorway
[Paola]:	Did he say anything? :o
[Daniel]:	He thought I was Daniel #1 which is how he distinguishes between the two Daniels haha
[Daniel]:	Chris is being hoisted
[Daniel]:	How is your timing for lunch?
[Paola]:	why?
[Paola]:	12:05?
[Paola]:	nvm
[Paola]:	12:10
[Daniel]:	Well there is no rush. Tell me when you have a better idea?
[Daniel]:	I’m out front
[Paola]:	Don't be shy lets laugh at Marisol too when we see her
[Daniel]:	WHAT
[Daniel]:	I shared "image.png" using the new Google Chat.
		Click here to view.
[Daniel]:	ah man the gif was funny
[Daniel]:	Oh you are talking about how she laughed at us
[Daniel]:	By the way , shopping is the easy option and I know that I can do that. I need a picture frame, possibly a new coffee table , I am sure some groceries, and probably some new pants and shirts (which we could thrift)
[Paola]:	Yeah, that's what I meant.
[Paola]:	Is that plan with or without Carol?
[Daniel]:	Either but also the plan wouldnt be to do all that. maybe just have time for like one or two
[Daniel]:	We could also play board games
[Daniel]:	With carol
[Daniel]:	Like go pick one out and play it
[Paola]:	At your place?
[Daniel]:	Either that or I am sure there is a place (maybe like a coffee shop) that would have a bunch of board games to choose from , that could be a vibe
[Daniel]:	So the plan would be to go grab breakfast, then head back to my place and play villainous until mass and if carol doesnt want to go we can drop her off.
[Daniel]:	OR we take the game to a local coffee shop and just sit at a table and play for awhile
[Daniel]:	OR we dont bring carol and just hang out well into the night after church
[Daniel]:	Also after church we could all do dinner
[Daniel]:	Maybe tacos?
[Daniel]:	Personally (and selfishly) I would like to get rid of carol before/after mass so we could get some alone time but I wouldn't force that issue, it'd just be my preference. I will send all this in a text now too.
[Daniel]:	🙁
[Paola]:	?
[Daniel]:	I said comiste to rosa and I meant comi 🙁
[Daniel]:	They're laughing at me now
[Daniel]:	I can hear them 😆
[Daniel]:	I said comiste camarones ayer
[Daniel]:	Good practice though
[Paola]:	🙁 its ok. They don't know English so it's even
[Daniel]:	TRUE
[Daniel]:	Plus to know that I need to go past tense after only going at this for a month
[Daniel]:	Its still embarassing
[Paola]:	AND you are learning!
[Paola]:	Hit them with your English then
[Paola]:	Show them who is my man
[Daniel]:	^ sexist actually
[Daniel]:	Better
[Paola]:	?
[Paola]:	No entendi
[Daniel]:	Haha I sent a strong arm then I thought "but girls are strong too" so I erased it
[Daniel]:	I will show them who your man is by showing them how much I care about you and to what lengths I will go to learn a new language
[Daniel]:	A message was edited in Google Chat; view the updated message on (
		https://chat.google.com/dm/1ltWFwAAAAE
		).
[Paola]:	Don't learn Spanish with them though. Only I can teach you and you may only practice with me until you can start and end a conversation with them.
[Daniel]:	Well I want to, but I think its good for me to talk with other people. You are too forgiving. When I talk to others my brain locks up because of nerves and that is exactly how it will be when I talk to your parents
[Daniel]:	But if you say so
[Paola]:	What do you mean too forgiving?
[Daniel]:	I mean you try to help me (especially because you know english). They will have to understand what I am saying simply from context . I can't backtrack in real conversations and say "I meant to say comi" because they dont understand "I meant to say"
[Daniel]:	esta bien por que tu eres mi maestra
[Daniel]:	no practicamos hoy :(
[Paola]:	:c no hoy no practicamos
[Daniel]:	te llamo esta noche y podemos practica un poco
[Daniel]:	los trabajadores de producion estan dejando
[Paola]:	?
[Daniel]:	The production workers all left
[Daniel]:	You should meet me in the back if you can find any extra time
[Paola]:	ok me esperas un momento
[Daniel]:	Oops I think I just messed that up
[Daniel]:	It’s tough when my Spanish is so bad that I get a different meaning and then do something based on that
[Paola]:	Are you in the back?
[Daniel]:	Now perhaps I know on a tiny level how you might feel when you learned english
[Paola]:	Ya voy pues
[Paola]:	A los 45 voy a ir
[Paola]:	para que mi jefe no se le hago raro
[Daniel]:	tu es rara 😆
[Daniel]:	eres
[Daniel]:	Is andrew here?
[Paola]:	nope
[Daniel]:	gracias por la conversacion buena. Hiciste mi manana va rapido
[Paola]:	Gracias a ti. Te fuiste justo a tiempo antes de que nos viera mi jefe
[Daniel]:	nuestros jefe, cierto?
[Daniel]:	tu y yo somos igualmente
[Paola]:	Bueno si es verdad
[Paola]:	Well last time you said Andrew era tu jefe
[Daniel]:	Si my jefe imediamente es Andrew, pero trabajo menor que con Chris. Pero el es el proprietario de la negocio.
[Daniel]:	lo es por que el es mi jefe tambien
[Daniel]:	en este punto donde esta Andrew? lol
[Paola]:	Supongo que no vendra hoy
[Daniel]:	dijo lo viene en un momento
[Daniel]:	mmmm no how do I say that?
[Daniel]:	"he said hes coming soon"
[Paola]:	"Dijo que vendra pronto"
[Daniel]:	Si quise usar "pronto" tambien
[Paola]:	Me ayudas
[Paola]:	pls...
		Does this make sense?
		I shared "image.png" using the new Google Chat.

[Paola]:	or is it still the harnesses that you don't understand yet
[Daniel]:	Usually people only buy o2 right?
[Paola]:	Yes
[Paola]:	the newer version
[Daniel]:	I thought we pretty much only sell o1 to BMZ
[Paola]:	maybe
[Paola]:	I have no idea honestly with BMZ
[Daniel]:	I would reword this under the assumption that he wants o2
[Paola]:	Well the thing is he order the items all mixed up
[Paola]:	so we are not sure if he will be using them with an O1 or O2
[Paola]:	I'm telling you Justin es un poco menso
[Paola]:	Mejor entiendo yo que el
[Daniel]:	Well the way you worded this last sentence, it is a question, so you either need to reword it or place a question mark. I can reword it for you gimme a second
[Daniel]:	Nevermind, I need to read more carfeully. Try this: "If you will be using an old current sensor with the O1, you will need the CWHCURTH, otherwise if you plan on using the newer current sensor with O1 you will need the CWHC2TH."
[Daniel]:	A message was edited in Google Chat; view the updated message on (
		https://chat.google.com/dm/1ltWFwAAAAE
		).
[Daniel]:	See the edit
[Daniel]:	And say O1 BMS like you did.
[Daniel]:	Honestly it was probably fine the way it was
[Daniel]:	Your english is very good
[Daniel]:	It DID make sense
[Paola]:	Are you sure? No me mientes?
[Paola]:	Because I was going to switch it
[Paola]:	ya llego tu jejfe
[Paola]:	jefe*
[Paola]:	bueno se metio a su oficina
[Daniel]:	Just use my wording then . Here is the thing... and this is very particular english, but usually you don't repeat yourself. So if you are essentially saying the same thing twice you need to find a new way to say it. For instance you would probably say the following if we were really trying to be correct:  "Also, if you plan on using an old current sensor with the O1 BMS, you will need the CWHCURTH, otherwise if you want to use the newer current sensor you will need the CWHC2TH."
[Daniel]:	However I still dont think he wants O1
[Daniel]:	So this is superfluous
[Daniel]:	(in excess an dnot necessary)
[Paola]:	ok I added your line
[Paola]:	I shared "image.png" using the new Google Chat.

[Daniel]:	I feel like I am terrible at this help and I am glad this is your job lol
[Paola]:	And I also switched it up at the beginning
[Daniel]:	Makes sense to me
[Daniel]:	mandes
[Daniel]:	mandas
[Daniel]:	lo mandas
[Paola]:	si
[Paola]:	gracias

[Daniel]:	Memez
[Paola]:	muy chistoso
[Daniel]:	tu conoces este meme?
[Paola]:	nope
[Daniel]:	🙁 esta triste
[Paola]:	tu?
[Daniel]:	no conoces los memes antiguos
[Paola]:	Pues yo estoy joven
[Paola]:	hahah es broma
[Daniel]:	Haha te piensas chistosa?
[Daniel]:	estas dijiendo yo soy viejo??
[Daniel]:	diciendo
[Paola]:	Hahaa cuando dijo eso?
[Paola]:	solo digo que yo estoy joven
[Daniel]:	Si estas mas joven que yo y me hace muy viejo
[Daniel]:	You always say that 😆
[Daniel]:	Esta tampoco tiempo para almorzar
[Daniel]:	tengo los camarones
[Paola]:	Yo tengo sopa
[Daniel]:	lista?
[Paola]:	Si
[Daniel]:	Using restroom then pulling atound
[Daniel]:	I’m out front
[Daniel]:	Te quiero
[Daniel]:	gracias para almorzar
[Paola]:	Yo tambien te quiero.
[Paola]:	"Gracias por almorzar conmigo"
[Paola]:	I'm guessing that's what you meant
[Daniel]:	Si
[Daniel]:	No se si debo usar por o para 😥
[Paola]:	I shared "image.png" using the new Google Chat.

[Paola]:	Dime si te ayuda esto
[Daniel]:	this is memorization. vamos hablar mas y yo voy a apprender.
[Paola]:	Esta bien
[Daniel]:	I think my options are all Asian food for tonight. Thai, pho or poke bowls? Specifically vino Thai, pho95 and poke bros
[Daniel]:	I nearly just jumped up from my seat to stop your cousin
[Daniel]:	I can tell you are busy and there is no rush. I will leave when you are ready 🙂
[Paola]:	I'm leaving at 5
[Paola]:	8hr boundary
[Daniel]:	Lol
[Daniel]:	Okie
[Paola]:	is the car unlocked?
[Paola]:	Should I wait for you in the back?
[Daniel]:	yikes
[Paola]:	I shared "image.png" using the new Google Chat.

[Paola]:	Como le digo que a la hora que sea esta bien?
[Daniel]:	contesta en espanol
[Daniel]:	I dare you
[Paola]:	Que chistoso
[Daniel]:	You probably should say that 3-5 or 4-5 is bad because of the shipping fiascos I have seen in the last week or two ...
[Daniel]:	Right?
[Paola]:	That is true. They rarely have interviews at that time though.
[Daniel]:	Still , it adds complexity to your answer. You want me to phrase it for you? cause I would just say "Really any time works for me, however sometimes we get busy with shipping around 3 or 4 and that can go until 5."
[Daniel]:	Or just say "shipping gets busy in the late afternoons or something"
[Daniel]:	You don't have to be so specific
[Paola]:	-_-
[Paola]:	smh I already answered though
[Daniel]:	That is fine
[Daniel]:	I am sure it went gr8
[Paola]:	I didn't want it to take too long for me to answer
[Daniel]:	Well any of the options I gave are good so if you used any of them
[Paola]:	Sort of yeah
[Daniel]:	You know your english is fantastic right? You don't need me for that.
[Paola]:	Well expect for the times I say "hanged up" instead of "hung up"
[Daniel]:	So that is just a few verbs that you dont realize have changing word forms in the past tense. Much like poner --> puse. Next time you can send me what you want to say and I can just proofread?
[Paola]:	Yes, please. That will truly help.
[Daniel]:	Then lets do that next time. I'd prefer to see what you come up with rather than barfing back up exactly what I say.
[Paola]:	Ok I will send you my email draft first.
[Paola]:	Why is Marisol watering the plants??
[Daniel]:	Yeah I defnitely thought she did it until yesterday when you did it lol
[Daniel]:	Dont be shy elbow her and take the bucket
[Paola]:	Well I don't see her watering the plants inside the office; just outside.
[Paola]:	How about something better
[Daniel]:	You want me to water them too?
[Daniel]:	I am confused by what could be "better"
[Paola]:	Te digo en lonche
[Paola]:	Quieres almorzar conmigo?
[Daniel]:	cien percento
[Paola]:	Cien porciento*
[Daniel]:	lo siento
[Paola]:	Esta bien te perfono
[Paola]:	perdono*
[Paola]:	oops haha
[Daniel]:	Are you ready for lunch?
[Paola]:	Yes
[Daniel]:	I’ve got to warm stuff up
[Paola]:	Si esta bien
[Daniel]:	I’m out front
[Daniel]:	necesitas lavar tus manos?
[Daniel]:	Sorry if I said "you can do it", I really did mean for you to tell me what you are expecting cause I can tell part of this is probably from your dad taking good care of your cars and of course I want to live up to that standard.
[Daniel]:	But yeah I guess I get to leave it at that and make an attempt at it tonight. Have a good afternoon :D
[Daniel]:	I can chat now :) te quiero
[Paola]:	yo tambien te quiero (:
[Paola]:	sabes que, perdi mi tarjeta de nuevo
[Daniel]:	no supe :( lo siento.
[Paola]:	I lost my card again
[Daniel]:	Voy a mirar en mi casa esta noche
[Daniel]:	Y yo entendí que tu dijiste
[Paola]:	tal ves este en mi casa
[Paola]:	So guess what
[Daniel]:	You actually want me to guess?
[Paola]:	There is a missing box that was supposed to arrive yesterday at the front door or back door...which means.. camera mode on
[Daniel]:	Yeah I would never have guessed that.
[Daniel]:	But kinda cool
[Daniel]:	maybe we will catch this porch snatcher
[Daniel]:	porch pirate**
[Paola]:	-_-
[Paola]:	Do you know what that means
[Daniel]:	I don't think we have anything to worry about if that is what you are trying to say
[Daniel]:	I have seen them hunt for a thief that stole the catalytic converter from their prius
[Daniel]:	They looked at one camera at like 5x speed
[Daniel]:	My sister Lydia was in a pretty serious car accident she's fine, but its kinda eye opening that she could have been taken while still so distant from our family 🙁
[Paola]:	🙁 I'm really sorry to hear that. Hopefully, this makes her realize what she is doing wrong and value her family more. Because we never know what will happen tomorrow.
[Daniel]:	I think we all hope the same. She did respond to my brother Jonny after this so some change is definitely going on.
[Daniel]:	But back to us, are you really worried they will see something of us on the cameras that we dont want them to see?
[Paola]:	No its all good now
[Daniel]:	Hmm ok but do you think we have done something on the cameras we aren't supposed to?
[Paola]:	Well you tell me, you always leave when they come.
[Daniel]:	Ah this is true. I see what you are getting at
[Daniel]:	I didnt think of it like that
[Paola]:	(:
[Paola]:	Don't be shy let me borrow your hotspot
[Daniel]:	lithiumion is the password to the wifi lol
[Paola]:	Won't they get a notification tho?
[Paola]:	though*
[Daniel]:	No haha its just like comcast business. They are way to busy to see which device is connected
[Daniel]:	They'd have to go into their account and look at the security
[Daniel]:	I did send you my hotspot password though
[Daniel]:	I can see that you probably didn't get it if your data isnt working. the password is "stay0ut!" with a zero
[Paola]:	(:
[Paola]:	I think I have it now
[Paola]:	gracias
[Daniel]:	Share your music ???
[Paola]:	yes
[Paola]:	te veo en la cafeteria?
[Daniel]:	Ah me gusta esa si tu estas offreciendo
[Daniel]:	:( sorry i disconnected
[Daniel]:	Will you do me a favor and have a good evening
[Paola]:	It's ok and no
[Paola]:	sorry
[Paola]:	maybe next time
[Daniel]:	That’s too bad. Guess you’ll just be miserable then.
[Daniel]:	And my favor will be incomplete.
[Daniel]:	I have a fun night ahead of me. I’m going to fix my headlamps :D
[Daniel]:	As well as clean the car
[Paola]:	(: maybe not if its cold outside
[Daniel]:	Nah I’m done driving you home dangerously late at night.
[Paola]:	?
[Daniel]:	One of those “I have a girlfriend now 😳” type thoughts
[Daniel]:	What I mean is that I don’t like how it’s dangerous to get in my car at night.
[Daniel]:	And I especially don’t like that I’m now endangering my girlfriend.
[Daniel]:	hablas conmigo en chat por favor 🙏
[Paola]:	Si por supesto
[Daniel]:	I feel bad for the inconvenience about tonight. And I don't think you need to come if you dont want to.
[Paola]:	There is no inconvenience at all. I would love to help and be there with you.
[Daniel]:	:D you really are sweet
[Daniel]:	Plus it sounds like Andrew and Chris are going to let me borrow a starter so we should be good
[Daniel]:	And fast
[Daniel]:	And I got 167 for us
[Paola]:	You see, nothing to worry about. I'm very excited for today!
[Paola]:	Quieres almorzar conmigo?
[Daniel]:	cien porciento :D mi maestra me lo enseno
[Daniel]:	o me enseno esa
[Paola]:	The first one sounds right
[Daniel]:	167 is unlocked and ready for a very private lunch :D maybe our best yet in fact.
[Daniel]:	Let's just leave after Andrew if we could. They don't seem to want anyone else in there.
[Paola]:	Sounds good to me. I also have to do some shipments first.
[Daniel]:	I think you can take your time with that . Andrew's stomach is growling but sometimes he doesnt leave right at noon.
[Daniel]:	SOOO
[Daniel]:	asi es la hora almorzarnos
[Paola]:	Ya merito
[Daniel]:	no entendi pero estas lista?
[Paola]:	5mins
[Daniel]:	:) no rush, I really think you are going to like our setup
[Paola]:	(:
[Paola]:	wait for me ok
[Daniel]:	You just come and let me know and we can walk out together
[Daniel]:	Need me to heat anything up?
[Paola]:	Yes please
[Daniel]:	Man I wish we could take the afternoon off and just go back to my place
[Daniel]:	I don't know how this will work cause I am sure andrew will only give me the charger right at the end of the day and that is also when I need the uber to show up...
[Daniel]:	I think you will be getting in the car with me at that time ...
[Paola]:	I don't want you to worry at all. If you want we could just wait until your car is better to see each other after work. It could be on Friday, your favorite day to go out.
[Daniel]:	No, its not me who I thought would be worried. If you are cool hopping in an uber with me and andrew possibly standing right there then I say lets do it. I just don't want to force YOU into something that you don't want to do.
[Daniel]:	I will bet I can get that charger in this unit before end of day by saying I have to leave close to five and that I am taking an uber.
[Daniel]:	But tell me if you have any concern. We have options and we probably should have talked at lunch 🫤
[Daniel]:	One option is to tell andrew the uber is about to arrive then you get in it and tell him that you are waiting for me while andrew and I grab the charger
[Daniel]:	I think that is best and seamless and will work well.
[Daniel]:	Please don't misunderstand, I really do want to hang out tonight. But I don't want to force you into anything. So that is why I leave the choice up to you :)
[Daniel]:	On a much happier note, I had fun at lunch in our private table :)
[Daniel]:	I will bet your cousin and her boyfriend learn a lot about each other by working so closely with each other
[Paola]:	They have been dating for a couple of years now.
[Paola]:	Speaking of her... I told you she was going to come again.. and Andrew was here smh
[Daniel]:	I DIDNT SEE
[Daniel]:	I cant believe I missed it :( I am sooo sorry
[Daniel]:	Did this just happen?
[Paola]:	I know you were gone
[Daniel]:	Damn I am so sorry
[Daniel]:	You can tell me about it after work. I swear I will hop up next time and stop her ...
[Daniel]:	So I will schedule the uber for 5:00 then?
[Paola]:	Yes
[Daniel]:	Should be here right at five 😀
[Daniel]:	Manar (our driver) is going to be about 3 minutes late
[Paola]:	Hopefully he doesn't say "just 2 mins" like someone I know
[Paola]:	(:
[Daniel]:	So I will go out as soon as he arrives and tell him we are waiting for you.
[Daniel]:	Happy Earth Day fellow earth dweller or something
[Paola]:	Diane said Happy Friday Jr
[Daniel]:	Is Andrew here?
[Paola]:	Nope
[Paola]:	only Pam
[Daniel]:	Oh it was pam
[Daniel]:	ugh
[Daniel]:	I didn't here the diet coke tab pop open
[Paola]:	Its coming
[Paola]:	he is here
[Daniel]:	Lol you are like a little warning system.
[Daniel]:	How's the coffee though?
[Daniel]:	Mine is wet, did you notice that too?
[Paola]:	hahhaa yes
[Paola]:	wet?
[Paola]:	Mine is still very hot so I'm blowing on it
[Daniel]:	The question is: is water wet or does it make things wet?
[Paola]:	I think it is wet
[Paola]:	What do you think?
[Daniel]:	Honestly I don't think I will ever know. One of the great philosophical questions of our generation.
[Paola]:	I shared "image.png" using the new Google Chat.

[Paola]:	...
[Paola]:	but why
[Daniel]:	Do you know what nymphomania is?
[Daniel]:	quieres almorzar conmigo?
[Paola]:	They need Jesus
[Paola]:	si por supuesto
[Daniel]:	a las doce?
[Daniel]:	o mas tarde
[Paola]:	Ya?
[Daniel]:	estas lista?

[Paola]:	Me encanta la cancion! <3
[Daniel]:	estoy feliz por que te gusta la cancion
[Daniel]:	Es una cancion muy famosa
[Paola]:	De verdad?
[Paola]:	Nunca la habia escuchado
[Daniel]:	estas emocionada tener un carro otra vez??
[Paola]:	Por supesto! Asi como tu ayer con tu carro
[Daniel]:	lo esta una broma? No me gusta mi carro ayer
[Daniel]:	nuestro jefe dijo adios!
[Paola]:	Por que?
[Daniel]:	por que el puede.
[Daniel]:	But actually that is what I am telling I am after
[Daniel]:	He was just like "Family duties are calling"
[Daniel]:	Do you think I can take off my mask when no one else is in the lab?
[Paola]:	I see. He really shows what are his priorities.
[Paola]:	hmmm I don't think so
[Daniel]:	He is a FAMILY MAN
[Daniel]:	Which is what my brothers and I call a good dad. My dad is also a family man
[Paola]:	?
[Paola]:	That is indeed a man.
[Daniel]:	Interesting. Its also a representation of hard work he has done in his life that hes stable enough now to be able to leave work and go do that. Of course its also kind of a privilege. Thoughts on that?
[Daniel]:	You should meet me in the back or something
[Paola]:	Did the hen see you
[Daniel]:	No I dont think so
[Daniel]:	I ran into the break room
[Paola]:	But she was heading over there
[Daniel]:	I heard a door close a good bit after I got into the break room
[Daniel]:	Was it chris?
[Paola]:	No it was Erika
[Paola]:	but good thing she didn't see you
[Daniel]:	en espanol por favor
[Paola]:	Me siento mal
[Paola]:	por que se mojo el correo
[Paola]:	🙁
[Daniel]:	Oops tu lo olvidaste tomar en la oficina?
[Paola]:	Si :( y estaba lloviendo
[Paola]:	y Chris lo miro y el salio afuera por el correo
[Daniel]:	lo esta mal. me siento responsable para olvidarte :/
[Paola]:	Pero no es como que puedo ver si esta lloviendo o no a cada rato
[Daniel]:	Pero Chris dijo gustarse el correo en el interior. Asi lo pones cerca de la puerta en el futuro.
[Daniel]:	Cierto?
[Daniel]:	Sorry I was asking not telling
[Paola]:	Si es verdad. Asi lo voy hacer de ahora en adelante.
[Paola]:	dont be shy come

[Paola]:	Pero es verdad 🫤
[Daniel]:	pero esta bien. estoy feliz con la direccion de esta relacion
[Daniel]:	especialmente ahorita
[Paola]:	Por que especialmente ahorita?
[Daniel]:	tenemos perpectiva. Nuestros dia a dia esta menos importante que el imagen grande :)
[Daniel]:	es importante que hacemos trabajos buenos
[Daniel]:	Like we keep saying we get to spend the rest of our lives together and that is super exciting but now we are actually acting like it.
[Daniel]:	Sorry I dont like sending long chats but you did ask 😆
[Paola]:	(: But I like long chats
[Daniel]:	lo dudo
[Paola]:	Por que?
[Paola]:	Me gusta cuando hay mas detalles

[Daniel]:	No supe. Pero lo puedo investigar. Cual día es tus hermanos “graduation”

[Paola]:	Va ser antes de los quince
[Daniel]:	Bueno, tengo más tiempo a practicar mi español.

[Daniel]:	el lonche de Chris estaba corto

[Paola]:	Si, pense que iba tardar mas
[Daniel]:	Tardar
[Daniel]:	lo esta nuevo
[Daniel]:	estas triste chris nos veo?
[Daniel]:	vio*
[Paola]:	Por supuesto que no. No estabamos haciendo nada malo
[Daniel]:	por que estas quejar?
[Paola]:	?
[Daniel]:	You seem upset that Chris saw us again today? All we are ever doing is washing our hands ...
[Paola]:	No, not at all. That's what I was just saying we weren't doing anything wrong.
[Daniel]:	Si si estamos bien.
[Daniel]:	esto es interesante: nuestros padres quieren reunir nuestros novios en el tiempo mismo.
[Daniel]:	en el fin de semana mismo exactamente
[Paola]:	Si haha yo tambien penso lo mismo cuando me dijo mi hermana la fecha de su graduacion
[Daniel]:	esta relacion nunca falla sorprender
[Paola]:	Creo que no entendi muy bien
[Daniel]:	this relationship never fails to surprise me. It is sort of an expression in english that I translated in spanish so it doesnt surprise me you didnt understand

[Daniel]:	Well I remember when we thought we could plan when we would meet each others parents but clearly that is not really going to happen.
[Paola]:	I see, that's good though. Something different everyday for us.
[Paola]:	What do you think your parents will say?
[Daniel]:	They will probably tell me they don't love me anymore
[Paola]:	haha why
[Paola]:	I do though
[Daniel]:	just kidding. They will be fine with it. May even move their time frame up or something
[Paola]:	mucho
[Daniel]:	mucho?? no poquito?
[Paola]:	mucho
[Paola]:	frame up?
[Daniel]:	"time frame" is the span of time that they will plan their vacation inside of
[Daniel]:	To to move their time frame up means that they will try to come at an earlier date
[Daniel]:	Or later
[Daniel]:	I think they wanted to visit that weekend because we get memorial day off (which I don't even know if that is true here at ewert)
[Paola]:	Oh I see. I think we do have that day off here at Ewert
[Paola]:	I will check in my calendar.
[Daniel]:	We should. I think its technically a national holiday and my parents would want to hangout that extra day. We should talk about this more in person
[Paola]:	Yes, I agree. Did you finish your shopping you had to do?
[Daniel]:	What shopping? por mis pantelones?
[Paola]:	Si
[Daniel]:	No, necesito comprar mas pantalones y camisas pero no quiero usar mis dinero con mi carro en la tienda de carros (???) esta semana.
[Daniel]:	A message was edited in Google Chat; view the updated message on (

[Paola]:	Ocupas el dinero para tu carro?
[Daniel]:	Yeah, just gotta make sure I can clear all the repairs I need
[Daniel]:	Which I will have a good idea of by friday most likely
[Daniel]:	Busy day over here
[Daniel]:	How are you? I miss you
[Paola]:	Same here
[Paola]:	I miss you too can't wait for lunch
[Daniel]:	Haha should be fun. We should pick up my car after
[Daniel]:	So you can drop me off and get back to clock in ⏰
[Paola]:	Yes, really short lunch then 🙁
[Daniel]:	You don't have to wait for me.
[Daniel]:	Itll be just 30 mins as it should be
[Daniel]:	Lunch?
[Paola]:	Si
[Paola]:	solo voy a calentar mi comida
[Daniel]:	necesito minutos
[Daniel]:	I miss you
[Daniel]:	Our time together is always too short
[Daniel]:	I would probably still say that even when we live together
[Paola]:	I agree 🙁 why does it have to be that way
[Paola]:	I think I've decided what to do now
[Paola]:	tengo sueno :c
[Daniel]:	Tienes sueno? Ahora? Quieres el cafe?
[Paola]:	Eso me va quitar el sueno?
[Paola]:	que si nos vemos hoy?
[Paola]:	sabes donde estan nuestros jefes?
[Daniel]:	No se pero yo creo en la oficina de andrew?
[Paola]:	No hay nadie
[Daniel]:	sus carros estan en el aparcadero
[Daniel]:	??
[Paola]:	Si, ahi estan
[Daniel]:	Interesante. Asi quieres cafe?
[Paola]:	Si esta bien
[Paola]:	para que me quite el sueno
[Daniel]:	Ahora?
[Paola]:	Manana si quieres
[Daniel]:	No entiendo
[Paola]:	(: its ok don't worry
[Daniel]:	voy a comprar el cafe ahora o lo puedo hacer. Pero voy a tener crema de cafe manana
[Daniel]:	los dos jefes estan "inactive" en chat
[Daniel]:	You ever seen this ^
[Daniel]:	A message was edited in Google Chat; view the updated message on (
		https://chat.google.com/dm/1ltWFwAAAAE
		).
[Paola]:	I've seen it before
[Paola]:	pero es raro
[Daniel]:	Found them lol
[Daniel]:	Did you say you had decided what you wanted to do?
[Paola]:	Yes (: 
		Take you to pick up your car. Then I'll go pump gas and head home for you to pick me up. 
		I think you could even just follow me over there. Why wait here.
[Daniel]:	Yay :) "why wait here" indeed. I will settle up at the shop while you pump gas and get situated at home and then come straight over then.
[Daniel]:	"settle up" means to pay
[Paola]:	2 more hours then (:
[Daniel]:	:D estoy emocionado. Tengo trabajar mucho antes de cinco.
[Paola]:	Ojala que se vallan rapido las dos horas
[Daniel]:	Si yo tambien
[Daniel]:	I don't think andrew and I are going to break my code today which is probably good for leaving on time
[Daniel]:	Do you think you will be ready right at five?
[Paola]:	yes
[Paola]:	Will you?
[Daniel]:	Yep
[Daniel]:	It sounds like Chris might be leaving??
[Paola]:	Hmm really?
[Daniel]:	Es possible, el dijo Aimtron necesita una cosa
[Daniel]:	Y el esta mas ocupado
[Daniel]:	muy ocupado *
[Daniel]:	I do that all the time
[Paola]:	Puede ser. o alomejor solo es por correo o llamada lo que Aimtron necesita
[Daniel]:	No, ellos necesitan esta cosa ahora
[Daniel]:	Pero es posible que tenemos un conductoro para lo conducir
[Paola]:	Pues el esta sentado en su escritoria como si nada
[Paola]:	Un conductor?'
[Daniel]:	A driver?
[Daniel]:	un mensajero
[Paola]:	Daniel just asked me for help
[Daniel]:	EFF THAT
[Daniel]:	So wack
[Daniel]:	Want me to beat him up for you?
[Paola]:	Didn't you see he brought me the boxes
[Daniel]:	I usually think he's going to talk to chris. Didn't you say that you were busy?
[Daniel]:	Like ask chris if this is actually a priority maybe?
[Paola]:	I don't want them to think I don't want to help or do the job from the warehouse. Neither would I want him to think I snitched or something
[Daniel]:	This is difficult and I honestly don't what to tell you. I don't have much experience solving issues like this.
[Daniel]:	I would defer to your judgement since you are so smart
[Daniel]:	🤓
[Paola]:	Wow, I don't know what to do either in this situation
[Daniel]:	Well fuck ... I mean the most passive thing is to not do the work and do your normal job then when he comes back you can just say you were busy?
[Paola]:	I don't want to get in trouble but neither would I want Daniel upset
[Daniel]:	Right, but upsetting chris is perhaps worse.
[Paola]:	That is true
[Daniel]:	Hmm
[Daniel]:	If you do what I suggest and essentially "let daniel down" then he probably will realize he can't "count on you" to do this for him in the future and he may stop asking?
[Daniel]:	I am also not saying that what I was saying to do is correct, I am just thinking here
[Daniel]:	I would definitely defer to your judgement here though so in the end you should decide what is best
[Paola]:	I know thank you . I will see what is best to do here
[Daniel]:	a bit of encouragement: I know you are smart and will make the right choice :)
[Daniel]:	quieres almorzar?
[Paola]:	Por supuesto
[Paola]:	Esperamos a Pam?
[Daniel]:	We wait on pam>
[Daniel]:	?
[Daniel]:	That is fine
[Paola]:	Ok (:
[Paola]:	yo te aviso cuando ya este aqui
[Daniel]:	debo calientar la comida?
[Paola]:	Si porfavor
[Paola]:	y me puedes traer un curita?
[Paola]:	pls
[Paola]:	Ya llego
[Daniel]:	HOW WAS YOUR COFFEE?
[Paola]:	Delicious! Thank you (:
[Daniel]:	No problem! You did confuse me today, but I think it will make for a good conversation the next time we hang out so I am going to save it 😉
[Paola]:	I'm sorry I figured that sort of did happen (:
[Daniel]:	I don't think you know what I am talking about but maybe you should just assume from now on that I am confused haha
[Paola]:	Hahaha great now I'm confused
[Daniel]:	Pam was like "WHO IS TALKING"
[Daniel]:	I have a really important question to ask you that requires an immediate answer:
[Daniel]:	Are you having a good afternoon?
[Paola]:	No :c
[Paola]:	imy
[Daniel]:	NOO? I believe I only asked one favor of you ...
[Daniel]:	I miss you too
[Daniel]:	Why does 20 feet seem so far?
[Daniel]:	7 meters?
[Daniel]:	What system do you guys use in your house
[Paola]:	Hahah what system?
[Daniel]:	metric or US customary
[Daniel]:	Does you talk about the temperature in Farenheit or Celsius and is it meters or feet/yards? Also kilograms and liters or pounds and gallons?
[Paola]:	Ohhh we use Farenheit, feet, and pounds
[Paola]:	what about your family?
[Daniel]:	Same, but engineers stick to the metric
[Daniel]:	Even more importantly though, happy administrative professionals - that is you!
[Paola]:	I'm just the assistant remember
[Daniel]:	Mhmm but technically you are called an administrative professional
[Daniel]:	Marisol be STARING
[Paola]:	Not surprised
[Daniel]:	So did you feel like you needed a nap today?
[Daniel]:	Don't be shy let me say goodbye to you before you leave
[Paola]:	Don't be shy then
[Daniel]:	Pull around to the back or something
[Paola]:	With the hens staring!? No thank you
[Daniel]:	With Chris and Pam staring is worse imo
[Daniel]:	Whatever
[Daniel]:	We can do it your way
[Daniel]:	One hen is in the coop taking her break right now
[Daniel]:	No entiendo
[Daniel]:	ella pregunta "mas coffee" and I was like "si tengo sueno"
[Paola]:	She asked in spanish?
[Daniel]:	I told you this one does not speak a lick of english
[Daniel]:	She is the one who I said "both" to and she didnt understand
[Paola]:	Oh I forgot. So many hens I can't keep up
[Daniel]:	Ok, so you want me to come out front?
[Daniel]:	no escribo enye en esta computadora
[Paola]:	hmm I'm not convinced
[Paola]:	tu no escribes bien?
[Daniel]:	no puedo digitar el enye ('n' especial) en esta computadora
[Paola]:	o es verdad
[Paola]:	No lo tiene esta computadora
[Daniel]:	I am glad you are safe here 🙂 I almost reached out to see if you were ok but didnt cause I figured you would if it was something I could help with and any extra texts from me would be a disruption otherwise.
[Paola]:	(: I did thought of giving you a call but I also knew you were probably already at work. Reason why I didn't call my dad either.
[Paola]:	But I do need a hug from you :c
[Paola]:	Just in time
[Daniel]:	I really would have come in a heartbeat. Work is not anywhere near as important to me as your safety.
[Daniel]:	You are literally my future. Your safety is the provision for our posterity, which I do believe I have mentioned once or twice as being the most important thing in the world to me. By natural extension, then, right now, your safety is the most important thing to me. Suddenly I feel very much like I underreacted and I apologize.
[Daniel]:	Quieres lonche a las doce?
[Paola]:	Me ganaste
[Paola]:	estas desocupado?
[Paola]:	Umm.. also, I was waiting for your jefe to leave that way you didn't receive my notification while he is there next to you... 
		but thank you <33 your words truly mean a lot to me. And there is no need to apologize. I will never hesitate again in reaching out to you. Also thank you for giving a hug. I love you and I can't wait to see you at lunch.

[Paola]:	or "Que pases buen dia" is another phrase we use
[Daniel]:	Gracias por la frase

[Paola]:	Good and bad. The sniffling didn't let me sleep well. But I am very thankful my throat stopped hurting.
[Daniel]:	esta bien. bueno, ojala que termine esta noche. Necesitas sonarte tu nariz pero no me escuchas.
[Daniel]:	but I know you dont want to hear that so I guess I hope it stops as soon as possible because I can tell you are not doing well 🤒
[Paola]:	Trabajare desde casa 🫤
[Paola]:	Ya me voy
[Daniel]:	Ahora? quiero dejar adios
[Daniel]:	Sad you are not at your desk :(

[Paola]:	Te extrano..
[Daniel]:	Your chat is no longer hidden 😆
[Daniel]:	and I love you
[Paola]:	Why? haha
[Paola]:	I love you
[Daniel]:	Because I am sitting at my desk again.
[Daniel]:	But how are you FEELING???
[Paola]:	Do you miss me?
[Paola]:	And honestly still the same
[Daniel]:	Of course I miss you. I keep walking back into the lab and you’re not at your desk :(

[Paola]:	hola
[Daniel]:	quieres hablar en chat hoy?
[Daniel]:	solo quiero entender como te sientes 😆
[Paola]:	Haha no quieres hablar conmigo 🙁 y me siento algo mejor pero estoy estornudando mucho
[Daniel]:	Where’d you get that idea? Of course I want to talk to you. Glad you are feeling better!! Estornudando es nuevo y muy chistoso a me 😆
[Paola]:	Do you love me? :c
[Paola]:	Yes! Do you know what estornudando means?
[Paola]:	Esta Pam en la oficina?
[Daniel]:	of course I love you. I was only saying that I wanted to know how you were feeling. I really want to talk to you. I had to translate it but definitely learned estornudar today haha
[Daniel]:	Si pam esta aqui
[Daniel]:	ella ya abierto su coke hoy
[Daniel]:	where would you put "ya" in that sentence?
[Paola]:	Well ahora te toca a ti decirme como va tu dia? Es mejor que ayer? Ya quiero que sea manana para poder verte y abrazarte
[Paola]:	You used it correctly. It is exactly where I would put "ya"
[Daniel]:	Por que no quieres verme hoy? "i'm curious" y la contesta a tu pregunta es muy complicado :/
[Daniel]:	A better way for me to ask that is like "tienes planes hoy?"
[Paola]:	Por que complicado? Muchas cosas? Podemos hablar por telefono si quieres y me cuentas?
[Paola]:	Si un poco hoy :c
[Paola]:	por eso decia que manan
[Paola]:	manana*
[Daniel]:	Si por supuesto. Que es tu planes? Quiero saber a tu dia a dia
[Paola]:	Voy a companar a mi mama a un cita que dijo que tenia con el doctor
[Daniel]:	Si! Necesita una translator? Me encanta a ti cuando la sirves
[Daniel]:	Lo siento podemos llamar pero es muy dificil para hablarlo ahora :(
[Paola]:	Si, por que la mayoria de veces hablan solo ingles
[Paola]:	Esta bien no te preocupes
[Paola]:	podemos hablar cuando tengas tiempo
[Paola]:	o cuando se pueda
[Daniel]:	Por que usas subjuntivo aqui?
[Daniel]:	puedes explicar o debo investigar?
[Daniel]:	A message was edited in Google Chat; view the updated message on (
		https://chat.google.com/dm/1ltWFwAAAAE
		).
[Paola]:	La verdad no se que es subjuntivo?
[Daniel]:	esta bien. me lo investigue. Usas subjuntivo cuando quieres expresar cosas subjetivas. lo haces naturalmente sin pensando.
[Daniel]:	lo necesito pensando porque no se la idioma
[Daniel]:	A message was edited in Google Chat; view the updated message on (
		https://chat.google.com/dm/1ltWFwAAAAE
		).
[Daniel]:	cosas subjetivas son cuando usas "dudo que" y "ojala que" siempre usas subjuntivo pero en eso rato lo usaste y no entendi porque no hubo ningun senal
[Daniel]:	Como estas mi amor? me dices como esta tu dia?
[Paola]:	Estoy bien pero te extrano :c
[Paola]:	Tu me extranas?
[Paola]:	Siento que llevo mucho tiempo sin verte haha
[Daniel]:	Si te extrano, y si mucho tiempo, pero piensas al verano cuando no nos vemos por dos semanas.
[Paola]:	No lo quiero ni pensar :c
[Daniel]:	pero esta necesario a practicar
[Paola]:	Supongo que si. Pero hablaremos todos los dias si?
[Daniel]:	Ok , honestly there is something that has been bothering me and this topic is heavily related to it. So I don't think we should talk about this anymore.
[Daniel]:	pero por supuesto lo quiero
[Daniel]:	te quiero
[Daniel]:	The new guy on the production floor just walked in from lunch smelling a good weed smoke and wearing a sweatshirt that says "thanks for smoking with us"
[Daniel]:	😆
[Daniel]:	Also literally everyone here is sick and I think I might be too 🤢
[Paola]:	Estoy confundida pero esta bien.
[Paola]:	Quien mas esta enfermo?
[Paola]:	Tu tambien??? Por mi culpa?? :c
[Daniel]:	no its not your fault in fact I would argue that this makes it obvious that you didnt get sick from playing soccer a week ago.
[Daniel]:	I am not doctor but I am pretty sure germs need warmth to grow, not cold.
[Paola]:	Well, I didn't get a fever and that usually happens when you get an infection or something related to germs. Which means I did get a cold from that.
[Daniel]:	Ok babe, I am not really in the mood for this. In fact, I think I am being rather rude so please forgive me. I am really not feeling like myself today :( I am really sorry.
[Paola]:	:( Que tienes?
[Paola]:	Are you feeling sick or having a bad day at work?
[Paola]:	Or both?
[Daniel]:	estoy teniendo un dia malo
[Daniel]:	Solo quiero abrazarte haha pero es una buena práctica
[Daniel]:	tienes una buena noche y ojala que el doctor dice tu mama esta muy saludables
[Paola]:	Gracias, te quiero. Que descanses.
[Daniel]:	Te quiero
[Daniel]:	y no lo recuerdas
[Paola]:	Si lo recuerdo
[Paola]:	Solo que aveces es bonito que me lo digas (:
[Daniel]:	asi voy a decirte a menudo
[Paola]:	Si (: Me alegra poder verte hoy!
[Paola]:	Estoy emocionada de verte todo el dia!
[Daniel]:	Si este dia ya esta mejor que ayer
[Paola]:	En la tarde quisiera ir a comprarle algo a mi madre por el dia de las madres. Quieres ir conmigo?

[Daniel]:	The other guy will not work here long. He walked in yesterday after lunch and smelled like he just smoked a lot of weed and our policy, clearly stated, is no smoking on the premise.

[Daniel]:	I got 🪲🐞
[Daniel]:	I need a 🦆
[Paola]:	😮
[Daniel]:	WAIT
[Daniel]:	No puedes recibir mis mensajes especiales
[Paola]:	Por que no?
[Daniel]:	no fuiste a la detras
[Daniel]:	pretty lady 😍
[Daniel]:	I don't like this 😭
[Daniel]:	^that emoji was called "loudly crying"
[Daniel]:	Tell me if you need coffee!
[Paola]:	I don't like this either :,((
[Daniel]:	Babe I am genuinely sad. But I guess we should be happy. The reasons are kinda long, so tell me if you want me to put them in chat or to talk at lunch.
[Paola]:	😞Happy?
		Don't be shy put them in chat
[Daniel]:	well the first one is this: we won't work in the same office forever, and we knew this. So this could be seen as like a step towards that inevitability. Good practice kinda like for this summer.
[Daniel]:	Like especially today because we couldn't even meet over at the bathroom if we wanted to
[Daniel]:	Respond to that and then I will give the second reason
[Paola]:	Babe
[Paola]:	I think I won't be able to chat
[Paola]:	I will be showing Issac what a day at Ewert looks like
[Daniel]:	All good, I kinda figured something like this
[Daniel]:	Hey maria, will you be taking your lunch at noon as usual?
[Paola]:	Babe I let him go first
[Paola]:	I honestly don't know how this will work
[Paola]:	Maybe I will go after he has 15 mins
[Daniel]:	Oh don't worry about it, I just had no idea haha
[Paola]:	Yes?
[Daniel]:	We can go later haha I love a late lunch personally
[Paola]:	You would prefer a late lunch?
[Paola]:	What time?
[Daniel]:	I always have , but whatever time works for you, I feel like you get really hungry in the middle of the day.
[Daniel]:	Why don't you just tell me whenever works for you. And if you need something warmed maybe I should come grab it now?
[Paola]:	I think 12:15 would work just because I think I should be training him
[Paola]:	And I think I don't have anything to heat up (:
[Daniel]:	Works for me , I have never wanted to eat lunch this bad
[Daniel]:	And I am not even that hungry 💔
[Daniel]:	He may be out front in his car. If you feel that is awkward, I can stay in back. Whatever you are comfortable with.
[Paola]:	I honestly just want to see you
[Paola]:	You can come to the front
[Daniel]:	Cool, I will do it now 🙂
[Daniel]:	I’m out front
[Daniel]:	No rush
[Daniel]:	Tell me when that is over so I can serve you your coffee

[Daniel]:	hace ayudarme pero todavia es differente que cuando lo hablo

[Paola]:	Bueno pues yo te ayudo de la manera que tu quieras
[Daniel]:	Si por favor. No quiero nada detener

[Daniel]:	pero estoy flexible y nos vemos todos los dias en la oficina
[Paola]:	Um mejor en ingles por que es importante y aveces no te entiendo
[Daniel]:	si te acuerdo
[Daniel]:	So you want to see each other today and not again until friday correct?
[Paola]:	Yes?
[Daniel]:	Which is fine, for some reason in my head I pictured tomorrow and friday since that is every other day. but I am flexible of course.
[Paola]:	I mean we could do that too
[Paola]:	to?
[Daniel]:	claro que paso tiempo contigo hoy
[Daniel]:	I'd rather see you today because that thought of "wednesday and then friday" is not flexible and I am really trying to practice it
[Daniel]:	Plus I am beginning to realize (especially because you are so flexible) that if I remain totally flexible it often works out in my favor.
[Daniel]:	Being rigid is the bad thing.
[Paola]:	How does it work in your favor?
[Daniel]:	Oftentimes I end up seeing you more than every other day
[Daniel]:	At least that is how it feels
[Daniel]:	like last night
[Paola]:	True you see
[Paola]:	But then I also understand if you have to fix your car
[Daniel]:	Well you may just have to give me a ride home and I figure tomorrow out. An uber is still cheaper than paying them to do it
[Daniel]:	hace mucho calor en el laboratorio
[Paola]:	I mean I can take you and also pick you up tomorrow
[Paola]:	remember that tomorrow is our coffee date
[Daniel]:	Oh sheesh! yeah! well then that would probably be best. I honestly don't trust my car to get me to work and stuff tomorrow :/
[Daniel]:	You sure that isn't too much trouble?
[Paola]:	Babee of course not. I will just let my mom know I will keep the car today
[Daniel]:	This is when it would really come in handy if we could sleep together
[Paola]:	I know 🙁
[Daniel]:	esta bien. vamos a practicar mi espanol. No quiero que dejes mi casa en la noche sin me
[Daniel]:	puedo usar "sinmigo" ? eata bien?
[Paola]:	Como que no se escucha muy bien
[Daniel]:	:( isaac o yo?
[Daniel]:	tal vez voy a estar un poca tarde
[Paola]:	Que tan tarde?
[Daniel]:	dos minutos
[Daniel]:	😆
[Daniel]:	No mas que quince
[Paola]:	Bueno esta ves si quiero un bubble tea. Si quieres voy y despues regreso por ti?
[Daniel]:	no vamos juntos 😀 just give me a little time
[Daniel]:	las tortugas te gustan?
[Paola]:	No no me gustan
[Daniel]:	triste, hay un bar en chicago que tiene carreras de tortugas
[Daniel]:	en el viernes, quieres estar activa
[Paola]:	Carreras de tortugas?
[Paola]:	Tortugas de verdad?
[Daniel]:	"turtles of truth" 😆
[Paola]:	haha I meant real turtles
[Paola]:	Also creo que Chris escucho que necesitabas un ride
[Paola]:	verdad?
[Daniel]:	Ohhh si es possible. dije Andrew mi carro no me sirvo y lo estuvo en la detras por la noche.
[Daniel]:	Is that how you always say something is real? Like Isaac would have said "cafe de verdad"??
[Daniel]:	y si, tienen carreras de tortugas a las 5-9 el viernes
[Daniel]:	Tambien es un poco temprano y no vas a ver las luz :(
[Daniel]:	Tengo un "idea
[Daniel]:	ocurrnecia
[Daniel]:	Pero no traemos Raxanna
[Daniel]:	Hmm
[Paola]:	Ah ok que bueno que le dijiste. Por que creo que asi le dije Chris a Issac cuando le dijo que aun no habia llegado.
[Paola]:	What are you trying to say though?
[Paola]:	with Issac?
[Paola]:	Bueno la verdad se escucha interesante. No me gustan las tortugas pero se me hace interesante ver una carrera.
[Paola]:	By the way, I had something stuck in my head yesterday that I wanted to tell you. Yesterday I meant "Friction" not "Traction"
[Paola]:	lol
[Paola]:	That's it
[Daniel]:	No recuerdo el contexto cuando dijiste "traction" pero recuerdo que fui muy chistoso.
[Daniel]:	explicame?
[Daniel]:	Tambien Isaac en su dia primero dijo "I brought some real coffee" . Can you say "cafe de verdad" and in general, is that how you say something is real?
[Daniel]:	Si las tortugas estara interesante pero no podemos traer Roxanna. Pero tengo una ocurrencia para nos ("us") despues del bar o restaurante
[Daniel]:	piscina de ocho pelotas te gusta? Dijiste que jagaste en el pasado pero fue divertido para ti?
[Daniel]:	Creo que Lucky Strike en la ciudad es una buena  opcion por nuestros por que no estan carinosos a nuestros cartas.
[Daniel]:	"I think lucky strike is a good option for us because they don't card"

[Paola]:	Por que no podemos llevar a Roxanna al lugar de las tortugas?
[Paola]:	"Ocurrencia" no. Se dice "tengo una idea"
[Daniel]:	Hahah gracias
[Paola]:	Que juge que? a la pelota en la picina?
[Daniel]:	8 ball pool
[Daniel]:	haha I didnt think it would translate
[Daniel]:	You said the other day that you had played in a bar before. Well it's kinda my favorite but I would also want to do something you like to do.
[Daniel]:	I do have a surprise for friday though
[Paola]:	Ohhh yeah no hahah that would say "Billar"
[Paola]:	I kinda suck at it but I still played hahah
[Daniel]:	Ah but did you enjoy it??
[Daniel]:	lo disfrutaste?
[Paola]:	Supongo que si
[Daniel]:	Vamos a hablar mas a almorzar por que quiero hacer algos cosas que tu quieres hacer.

[Paola]:	Una pregunta, hay alguna manera que pueda ver mi cellular en la television asi como conectastes tu computadora?
[Daniel]:	tienes algunos opciones. Pero no se que es tu aplicacion o que tu quieres. la opcion de facil es uno apple tv pero chromecast va a hacer las cosas importantes tambien.
[Daniel]:	a que hora quieres almorzar?
[Paola]:	A las 12:15
[Daniel]:	me necesitas calientar tu comida?
[Daniel]:	On a completely unrelated note I keep having the weirdest thoughts about spanish. Its almost like a new version of self is forming (around you) but its not a new version of me its just like "How I think with her" kinda weird. I want to talk to Andrea Meza's boyfriend to see what he thinks of all this.
[Daniel]:	Oh my god I just realized that video you sent the other day on instagram was him.
[Daniel]:	Pues gracias por almorzaste conmigo. lo disfrute. me dijes si Isaac tambien es grosero a ti .
[Daniel]:	"I will beat him up"
[Daniel]:	Lol this mans is just not here right now
[Paola]:	lol what mans?
[Daniel]:	tu companero
[Daniel]:	uso el bano y estuvo "idle" 😆 no personas usan "idle" cuando usan el bano
[Paola]:	?
[Paola]:	No entiendo
[Daniel]:	He marked himself as idle when he went to the bathroom. Thought it was funny thinking that being on the toilet is idling.
[Paola]:	haha ni me di cuenta
[Daniel]:	yo voy a extranar hoy :(
[Paola]:	Yo ya te extrano
[Paola]:	Oye
[Paola]:	necesito que me hagas un favor
[Daniel]:	Que pasa
[Paola]:	para manana
[Paola]:	Me puedes dejar entrar temprano manana
[Paola]:	poquito antes que las gallinas
[Paola]:	aver si no esta el nuevo
[Paola]:	aun
[Daniel]:	Si yo puedo pero el no puede estar aquí hasta a las ocho por que no puede abrir la puerta.
[Daniel]:	Te quiero. Quieres el cafe?
[Paola]:	Yo tambien te quiero
[Paola]:	y no gracias
[Daniel]:	Como estas mi amor?
[Daniel]:	I am really sorry but since last night for some reason this issue has hit me really hard and all I could think about is moving past it.
[Daniel]:	Tuve una nota pero Isaac esta ayi
[Daniel]:	really sorry for last night and this morning*
[Paola]:	La verdad, no estoy bien.
[Paola]:	But I understand.
[Daniel]:	Por que??
[Paola]:	And its fine about the note
[Paola]:	I knew he would be here
[Daniel]:	Que pasa? Por que no estas bien?
[Paola]:	Tu estas bien?
[Daniel]:	te quiero contestar mi pregunta :( y no, tambien no estoy bien.
[Daniel]:	podemos reunirnos en la detras? o en el bano? quiero abrazarte
[Daniel]:	cuando estas lista
[Paola]:	y las gallinas
[Daniel]:	I honestly don't care about them and the first time we did it it was your idea so I know you don't either.
[Daniel]:	What I care about is you and if youre not well then I want to help in whatever way I can. If that means leaving you be then that is fine.
[Paola]:	Es verdad
[Daniel]:	Te quiero paola. No me gusta estar confundido contigo. Pero esta relacion es muy importante.

[Daniel]:	I think I just saved our chat history
[Daniel]:	Apparently it could take hours
[Paola]:	How did you save it?
[Paola]:	or where?
[Daniel]:	It is now on my computer in a JSON file.
[Daniel]:	Your boyfriend is going to have to decode all this.
[Daniel]:	"Maria wants to go to a carnival" to nabeel
[Daniel]:	"maria just came in here and said hello to me today" to nabeel , this is going to be fun
